The File class’s open method is used to open the text file, text.txt, and upon that File
object, the each method returns each line one by one. You can also do it this way:
File.new("text.txt", "r").each { |line| puts line }
This method clarifies the process involved. By opening a file, you’re creating a new File
object that you can then use. The second parameter, "r", defines that you’re opening the file
for reading. This is the default mode, but when using File.new, it can help to clarify what you
want to do with the file. This becomes important later when you write to files or create new
ones from scratch.
