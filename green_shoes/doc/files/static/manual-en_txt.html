<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is a tiny graphics toolkit.
It’s simple and straightforward. <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> was born to be easy!  Really, it
was made for absolute beginners. There’s really nothing to it. Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is one of colorful <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>. It is written in pure Ruby  with
Ruby/GTK2.</p>

<p>You see, the trivial <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> program
can be just one line:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app{button(&quot;Click me!&quot;){alert(&quot;Good job.&quot;)}}</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs are written in a
language called Ruby.  When <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is
handed this simple line of Ruby code, a window appears with a button inside
reading “Click me!”  When the button is clicked, a message pops up.</p>

<p>On Windows 7, here’s how this might look: !{margin_left: 100}man-shot1.png!</p>

<p>While lots of <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> apps are
graphical games and art programs, you can also layout text and edit
controls easily. !{margin_left: 80}shoes-manual-apps.png!</p>

<p>And, ideally, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs will
run on any of the major platforms out there. Microsoft Windows, Apple’s Mac
OS X, Linux and many others.</p>

<p>^So, welcome to Green Shoes’ built-in manual. This manual is a Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> program itself!^</p>

<h2 id="label-Introducing+Green+Shoes+%3D%3D">Introducing Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ==</h2>

<p>How does Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> look on OS X
and Linux? Does it really look okay? Is it all ugly and awkward? People
must immediately convulse! It must be so watered down trying to do
everything.</p>

<p>Well, before getting into the stuff about installing and running Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, time to just check out some
screenshots, to give you an idea of what you can do.</p>

<h4 id="label-Mac+OS+X+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Mac OS X ====</h4>

<p>Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is confirmed on Apple
Mac OSX10.5 PPC via X11.  !{margin_left: 100}../snapshots/sample3-osx.png!</p>

<p>This is the `sample3.rb` on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>All circles are drawn randomly. You can draw and animate shapes in Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.</p>

<h4 id="label-Windows+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Windows ====</h4>

<p>Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is confirmed to run on
”‘Microsoft Windows XP”’ and ”‘Windows 7”’. !{margin_left:
0}../snapshots/sample33.png!</p>

<p>Above is pictured the `sample33.rb` running on Windows 7.  Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>  has three extended libraries for
chipmunk physics, bloopsaphone and 3D texture  mapping. First two are
binary libraries, so far work on Windows only.</p>

<h4 id="label-Linux+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Linux ====</h4>

<p>Here’s a screenshot of the `sample44.rb` running on ”‘Ubuntu on VirtualBox
for Windows”’. !{margin_left: 130}../snapshots/sample44-linux.png!</p>

<p>This example is also draws ovals and lines to build the clock, which is
animated to show or hide itself several times each second.</p>

<p>Notice the text on the top of the app, showing the current time. Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has the skills to layout words
using any color, bold, italics, underlines, and supports loading fonts.</p>

<h2 id="label-Installing+Green+Shoes+%3D%3D">Installing Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ==</h2>

<p>Okay, on to installing Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.
I’m sure you’re wondering: do I need to install Ruby? Do I need to unzip
anything? What commands do I need to type?</p>

<p>Yeah. You need to install Ruby and Gems. But, no need to worry about it.
We’ll talk through all the steps.</p>

<h4 id="label-Step+1%3A+Installing+Green+Shoes+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Step 1: Installing Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ====</h4>

<p>At first, install Ruby. On ”‘Windows”’,  visit the site of [[<a
href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">rubyinstaller.org/</a> RubyInstaller for
Windows]] to  download the latest ”‘RubyInstaller 1.9.2 or 1.9.3”’.</p>

<p>Then just do the following one line.</p>

<pre>* gem install green_shoes</pre>

<p>That’s all. Too easy?</p>

<p>”‘Note:”’ green_shoes gem is on [[<a
href="http://rubygems.org/gems/green_shoes">rubygems.org/gems/green_shoes</a>
RubyGems.org]]. If you get some errors of rdoc, try to add `–no-ri
–no-rdoc` option.</p>

<h4 id="label-Step+2%3A+Start+a+New+Text+File+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Step 2: Start a New Text File ====</h4>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs are just plain text
files ending with a ”‘.rb”’ extension.</p>

<p>Here are a few ways to create a blank text file:</p>

<pre>* On '''Mac OS X''', visit your '''Applications''' folder and double-click on the '''TextEdit''' app.  A blank editor window should come up.  Now, go to the '''Format''' menu and select the '''Make Plain Text''' option.  Okay, you're all set! !man-editor-osx.png!
* On '''Windows''', go to the Start menu.  Select '''All Programs''', then '''Accessories''', then '''Notepad'''. !man-editor-notepad.png!
* On '''Linux''', most distros come with '''gedit'''.  You might try running that.  Or, if your distro is KDE-based, run '''kate'''.</pre>

<p>Now, in your blank window, type in the following:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'green_shoes'</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Welcome to Shoes&quot;</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Save to your desktop as `welcome.rb`.</p>

<h4 id="label-Step+3%3A+Run+It%21+Go+Shoes%21+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Step 3: Run It! Go <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>! ====</h4>

<p>To run your program, just open console window and run the following.</p>

<pre>* ruby welcome.rb !man-editor-osx.png!</pre>

<p>So, not much of a program yet.  But it’s something!  You’ve got the knack
of it, at least!</p>

<h4 id="label-What+Can+You+Make+With+Shoes%3F+%3D%3D%3D%3D">What Can You Make With <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>? ====</h4>

<p>Well, you can make windowing applications. But <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is inspired by the web, so
applications tend to use images and text layout rather than a lot of
widgets. For example, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> doesn’t
come with tabbed controls or toolbars. <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is a ”tiny” toolkit, remember?</p>

<p>Still, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> does have a few widgets
like buttons and edit boxes. And many missing elements (like tabbed
controls or toolbars) can be simulated with images.</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is written in part thanks to a
very good art engine called Cairo, which is used for drawing with shapes
and colors. Also thanks to an awesome text  lay out engine called Pango. In
this way, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is inspired by
NodeBox and Processing, two very good languages for drawing animated
graphics.</p>

<h2 id="label-The+Rules+of+Green+Shoes+%3D%3D">The Rules of Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ==</h2>

<p>Time to stop guessing how Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> works.  Some of the tricky things
will come back to haunt you.  I’ve boiled down the central rules to Green
<a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  These are the things you
MUST know to really make it all work.</p>

<p>These are general rules found throughout Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  While Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has an overall philosophy of
simplicity and clarity, there are a few points that need to be studied and
remembered.</p>

<h4 id="label-Shoes+Tricky+Blocks+%3D%3D%3D%3D"><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> Tricky Blocks ====</h4>

<p>Okay, this is absolutely crucial.  Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> does a trick with blocks.  This
trick makes everything easier to read.  But it also can make blocks harder
to use once you’re in deep.</p>

<p>”‘Let’s take a normal Ruby block:”‘</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">ary</span> = [<span class="ruby-string">'potion'</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'swords'</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'shields'</span>]
  <span class="ruby-identifier">ary</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">each</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">item</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>
    <span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">item</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>In Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, these sorts of
blocks work the same.  This block above loops through the array and stores
each object in the `item` variable.  The `item` variable disappears (goes
out of scope) when the block ends.</p>

<p>One other thing to keep in mind is that `self` stays the same inside normal
Ruby blocks.  Whatever `self` was before the call to `each`, it is the same
inside the `each` block.</p>

<p>”‘Both of these things are also true for most Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> blocks.”’</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para &quot;First&quot;
    para &quot;Second&quot;
    para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Here we have two blocks.  The first block is sent to `<a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html#method-c-app">Shoes.app</a>`.  This `app`
block changes `self`.</p>

<p>The other block is the `stack` block.  That block does NOT change self.</p>

<p>”‘For what reason does the `app` block change self?”’  Let’s start by
spelling out that last example completely.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  self.stack do
    self.para &quot;First&quot;
    self.para &quot;Second&quot;
    self.para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>All of the `self`s in the above example are the App object.  Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> uses Ruby’s `instance_eval` to
change self inside the `app` block.  So the method calls to `stack` and
`para` get sent to the app.</p>

<p>”‘This also is why you can use instance variables throughout a <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> app:”’</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  @s = stack do
    @p1 = para &quot;First&quot;
    @p2 = para &quot;Second&quot;
    @p3 = para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>These instance variables will all end up inside the App object.</p>

<p>”‘Whenever you create a new <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html#method-c-app">Shoes.app</a> window, `self`
is also changed.”’</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app title: &quot;MAIN&quot; do
  para self
  button &quot;Spawn&quot; do
    Shoes.app title: &quot;CHILD&quot; do
      para self
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<h4 id="label-Block+Redirection+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Block Redirection ====</h4>

<p>The `stack` block is a different story, though.  It doesn’t change `self`
and it’s basically a regular block.</p>

<p>”‘But there’s a trick:”‘ when you attach a `stack` and give it a block, the
App object places that stack in its memory.  The stack gets popped off when
the block ends.  So all drawing inside the block gets ”’redirected”‘ from
the App’s top slot to the new stack.</p>

<p>So those three `para`s will get drawn on the `stack`, even though they
actually get sent to the App object first.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para &quot;First&quot;
    para &quot;Second&quot;
    para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>A bit tricky, you see?  This can bite you even if you know about it.</p>

<p>One way it’ll get you is if you try to edit a stack somewhere else in your
program, outside the `app` block.</p>

<p>Like let’s say you pass around a stack object.  And you have a class that
edits that object.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Messenger</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">initialize</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">slot</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@slot</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">slot</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">add</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">msg</span>
    <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">msg</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">rescue</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">$!</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">slot</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">m</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Messenger</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">new</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">slot</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">m</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">add</span> <span class="ruby-string">'hello'</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So, let’s assume you pass the stack object into your Messenger class when
the app starts.  And, later, when a message comes in, the `add` method gets
used to append a paragraph to that stack.  Should work, right?</p>

<p>Nope, it won’t work.  The `para` method won’t be found.  The App object
isn’t around any more.  And it’s the one with the `para` method.</p>

<p>Fortunately, each <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> object has
an `app` method that will let you reopen the App object so you can do some
further editing.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the `app` object changes `self` to the App object.</p>

<p>So the rules here are:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>”‘Methods named “app” or which create new windows alter `self` to the App</p>
</li></ol>

<h4 id="label-Careful+With+Fixed+Heights+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Careful With Fixed Heights ====</h4>

<p>Fixed heights on slots should be less common.  Usually you want your text
and images to just flow down the window as far as they can.  Height usually
happens naturally.</p>

<p>The important thing here is that fixed heights actually force slots to
behave differently.  To be sure that the end of the slot is chopped off
perfectly, the slot becomes a ”‘nested window”’.  A new layer is created by
the operating system to keep the slot in a fixed square.</p>

<p>One difference between normal slots and nested window slots is that the
latter can have scrollbars.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>These nested windows require more memory.  They tax the application a bit
more. So if you’re experiencing some slowness with hundreds of fixed-height
slots, try a different approach.</p>

<p>”‘Note:”’ Fixed height magic (the slot becomes a nested window) is
implemented  in Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> as a
trial so far. Need to add `flush` method.</p>

<p>Most beginners start littering the window with shapes.  It’s just easier to
throw all your rectangles and ovals in a slot.</p>

<p>Oh, wait.  The ovals aren’t filled in this time!  That’s because the ovals
have been combined into a single huge shape.  And <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> isn’t sure where to fill in this
case.</p>

<p>So you usually only want to combine into a single shape when you’re dealing
strictly with outlines.</p>

<p>Another option is to combine all those ovals into a single image.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>There we go!  The ovals are all combined into a single 300 x 300 pixel
image. In this case, storing that image in memory might be much bigger than
having one-hundred ovals around.  But when you’re dealing with thousands of
shapes, the image block can be cheaper.</p>

<p>The point is: it’s easy to group shapes together into image or shape
blocks, so give it a try if you’re looking to gain some speed.  Shape
blocks particularly will save you some memory and speed.</p>

<p>”Note:” Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> doesn’t support
this magic (grouping shapes together  into image or shape blocks) so far.</p>

<h4 id="label-UTF-8+Everywhere+%3D%3D%3D%3D">UTF-8 Everywhere ====</h4>

<p>Ruby itself isn’t Unicode aware.  And UTF-8 is a type of Unicode.  (See</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8</a> Wikipedia]
<dd>
<p>for a full explanation of</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>UTF-8.)</p>

<p>However, UTF-8 is common on the web.  And lots of different platforms
support it.  So to cut down on the amount of conversion that Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has to do,  Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> expects all strings to be in
UTF-8 format.</p>

<p>This is great because you can show a myriad of languages (Russian,
Japanese, Spanish, English) using UTF-8 in Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  Just be sure that your text
editor uses UTF-8!</p>

<p>To illustrate:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">margin</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">10</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@edit</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">edit_box</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
      <span class="ruby-ivar">@para</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">text</span> = <span class="ruby-ivar">@edit</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">text</span>
    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@para</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;&quot;</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This app will copy anything you paste into the edit box and display it in a
Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> paragraph.  You can try
copying some foreign text (such as  Greek or Japanese) into this box to see
how it displays.</p>

<p>This is a good test because it proves that the edit box gives back UTF-8
characters.  And the paragraph can be set to any UTF-8 characters.</p>

<p>”‘Important note:”’ if some UTF-8 characters don’t display for you, you
will need to change the paragraph’s font.  This is especially common on OS
X.</p>

<p>So, a good Japanese font on OS X is ”‘AppleGothic”’ and on Windows is ”‘MS
UI Gothic”’.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  para &quot;てすと (te-su-to)&quot;,
   font: case RUBY_PLATFORM
   when /mingw/; &quot;MS UI Gothic&quot;
   when /darwin/; &quot;AppleGothic, Arial&quot;
   else &quot;Arial&quot;
   end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Again, anything which takes a string in Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> will need a UTF-8 string. Edit
boxes, edit lines, list boxes, window titles and text blocks all take
UTF-8. If you give a string with bad characters in it, an error will show
up in the console.</p>

<h4 id="label-The+Main+App+and+Its+Requires+%3D%3D%3D%3D">The Main App and Its Requires ====</h4>

<p>”‘NOTE:”’ This rule is for Raisins. Policeman and Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> use TOPLEVEL_BINDING.  So, you
can get `main`, Ruby top-level object, with the first snippet. Although you
need to use `Shoes::Para` instead of `Para` outside `<a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html#method-c-app">Shoes.app</a>` block.</p>

<p>Each <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> app is given a little
room where it can create itself.  You can create classes and set variables
and they won’t be seen by other <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs.  Each program runs
inside its own anonymous class.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>main = self
Shoes.app do
  para main.to_s
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This anonymous class is called `(shoes)` and it’s just an empty, unnamed
class. The `Shoes` module is mixed into this class (using `include Shoes`)
so that you can use either `Para` or `Shoes::Para` when referring to the
paragraph class.</p>

<p>The advantages of this approach are:</p>

<pre class="ruby">* <span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">apps</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">cannot</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">share</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">local</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">variables</span>.

</pre>

<p>The second part is especially important to remember.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Storage</span>; <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>The `Storage` class will disappear once the app completes.  Other apps
aren’t able to use the Storage class.  And it can’t be gotten to from files
that are loaded using `require`.</p>

<p>When you `require` code, though, that code will stick around.  It will be
kept in the Ruby top-level environment.</p>

<p>So, the rule is: ”‘keep your temporary classes in the code with the app and
keep your permanent classes in requires.”’</p>

<p>Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is all about drawing

list of methods you can use for each topic covered. The idea is to be very
thorough and clear about everything.</p>

<p>After this general reference, there are two other more specific sections:</p>

<pre>* [[Slots]] - covering [[Element.stack]] and [[Element.flow]], the two types of slots.
* [[Elements]] - documentation for all the buttons, shapes, images, and so on.</pre>

<p>Two really important pages in there are the [[Element Element Creation]]
page (which lists all the elements you can add) and the [[Common Common
Methods]] page (which lists methods you’ll find on any slot or element.)</p>

<h2 id="label-Built-in+Methods+%3D%3D">Built-in Methods ==</h2>

<p>These methods can be used anywhere throughout Green <a

<p>All of these commands are unusual because you don’t attach them with a dot.
”‘Every other method in this manual must be attached to an object with a
dot.”’ But these are built-in methods (also called: <a

<p>A common one is `alert`:</p>

<p>Compare that to the method `reverse`, which isn’t a <a

<p>The angle at which to apply a gradient.  Normally, gradient colors range

<h3 id="label-%3Acurve+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:curve » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”background, border, rect”.</p>

<p>The radius of curved corners on each of these rectangular elements.  As an
example, if this is set to 6, the corners of the rectangle are given a
curve with a 6-pixel radius.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Adisplace_left+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:displace_left » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Moves a shape, text block or any other kind of object to the left or right.
A positive number displaces to the right by the given number of pixels; a
negative number displaces to the left.  Displacing an object doesn’t effect
the actual layout of the page.  Before using this style, be sure to read

<p>Moves a shape, text block or any other kind of object up or down.  A
positive number moves the object down by this number of pixels; a negative
number moves it up.  Displacing doesn’t effect the actual layout of the
page or the object’s true coordinates.  Read the [[Position.displace]]

<h3 id="label-%3Aemphasis+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:emphasis » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, inscription, para, span, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Styles the text with an emphasis (commonly italicized.)</p>

<p>This style recognizes three possible settings:</p>

<pre>* &quot;normal&quot; - the font is upright.
* &quot;oblique&quot; - the font is slanted, but in a roman style.
* &quot;italic&quot; - the font is slanted in an italic style.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Afamily+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:family » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, inscription, para, span, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Styles the text with a given font family.  The string should contain the
family name or a comma-separated list of families.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Afill+%C2%BB+a+hex+code%2C+a+rgb+array+or+a+range+of+either+%3D%3D%3D">:fill » a hex code, a rgb array or a range of either ===</h3>

<p>For: ”background, banner, border, caption, inscription, para, line, oval, 
rect, shape, star, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>The color of the background pen.  For shapes, this is the fill color, the
paint inside the shape. For textblock, this color is painted in the
background (as if marked with a highlighter pen.)</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Afont+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:font » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, inscription, para, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Styles the text with a font description.  The string is pretty flexible,
but can take the form “[FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]”, where
FAMILY-LIST is a comma separated list of families optionally terminated by
a comma, STYLE_OPTIONS is a whitespace separated list of words where each
WORD describes one of style, variant, weight, stretch, or gravity, and SIZE
is a decimal number (size in points) or optionally followed by the unit
modifier “px” for absolute size. Any one of the options may be absent. If
FAMILY-LIST is absent, then the default font family (Arial) will be used.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Afront+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:front » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”shapes, image, textblocks”.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Agroup+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:group » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”radio”.</p>

<p>Indicates what group a radio button belongs to.  Without this setting,
radio buttons are grouped together with other radio buttons in their
immediate slot. “Grouping” radio buttons doesn’t mean they’ll be grouped
next to each other on the screen.  It means that only one radio button from
the group can be selected at a time.</p>

<p>By giving this style a string, the radio button will be grouped with other
radio buttons that have the same group name.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aheight+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:height » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel height of this object.  If the number is a decimal number,
the height becomes a percentage of its parent’s height (with 0.0 being 0%
and 1.0 being 100%.)</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Ahidden+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:hidden » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the spacing between lines in a text block.  Defaults to 4 pixels.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aleft+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:left » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the left coordinate of this object to a specific pixel.  Setting
`left: 10`  places the object’s left edge ten pixels away from the left
edge of the slot containing it.  If this style is left unset (or set to
`nil`,) the object will flow in with the other objects surrounding it.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Amargin+%C2%BB+a+number+or+an+array+of+four+numbers+%3D%3D%3D">:margin » a number or an array of four numbers ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Margins space an element out from its surroundings.  Each element has a
left, top, right, and bottom margin.  If the `:margin` style is set to a
single number, the spacing around the element uniformly matches that
number.  In other words, if `margin: 8` is set, all the margins around the
element are set to eight pixels in length.</p>

<p>This style can also be given an array of four numbers in the form `[left,
top, right, bottom]`.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Amargin_bottom+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:margin_bottom » a number ===</h3>

<h3 id="label-%3Apoints+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:points » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”star”.</p>

<p>How many points does this star have?  A style of `points: 5` creates a
five-pointed star.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aradius+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:radius » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”oval”.</p>

<p>Sets the radius (half of the diameter or total width) for each of these
elements.  Setting this is equivalent to setting both `:width` and
`:height` to double this number.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aright+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:right » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel coordinate of an element’s right edge.  The edge is placed
relative to its container’s rightmost edge.  So, `:right =&gt; 0` will
align the element so that its own right edge and the right edge of its slot
touch. Whereas `:right =&gt; 20` will position the right edge of the
element off to the left of its slot’s right edge by twenty pixels.</p>

<p>For: ”flow, stack”.</p>

<p>Establishes this slot as a scrolling slot.  If `:scroll =&gt; true` is set,
the slot will show a scrollbar if any of its contents go past its height. 
The scrollbar will appear and disappear as needed.  It will also appear
inside the width of the slot, meaning the slot’s width will never change,
regardless of whether there is a scrollbar or not.</p>

<p>For: ”background, banner, border, caption, inscription, para, line, oval, 
rect, shape, star, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>The color of the foreground pen.  In the case of shapes, this is the color
the lines are drawn with. For textblock, the letters are printed in this
color.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Astrokewidth+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:strokewidth » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel width for the element.  If the number is a decimal, the
width is converted to a percentage (with 0.0 being 0% and 1.0 being 100%.) 
A width of 100% means the object fills its parent slot.</p>

<h2 id="label-Classes+List+%3D%3D">Classes List ==</h2>

<p>There is a complete list of all the classes introduced by Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.</p>

<p>Look at [[<a
href="http://rdoc.info/github/ashbb/green_shoes/master/frames/file/README.md">rdoc.info/github/ashbb/green_shoes/master/frames/file/README.md</a>
Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> RDoc]].</p>

<h2 id="label-Colors+List+%3D%3D">Colors List ==</h2>

<p>The following list of colors can be used throughout Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  As background colors or border
colors.  As stroke and fill colors.  Most of these colors come from the X11
and HTML palettes.</p>

<p>All of these colors can be used by name.  (So calling the `tomato` method
from inside any slot will get you a nice reddish color.)  Below each color,
also find the exact numbers which can be used with the [[Built-in.rgb]]
method.</p>

<p>{COLORS}</p>

<h1 id="label-Slots+%3D">Slots =</h1>

<p>Slots are boxes used to lay out images, text and so on. The two most common
slots are `stacks` and `flows`. Slots can also be referred to as “boxes” or
“canvases” in Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>
terminology.</p>

<p>Since the mouse wheel and PageUp and PageDown are so pervasive on every
platform, vertical scrolling has really become the only overflow that
matters. So, in Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, just as
on the web, width is generally fixed. While height goes on and on.</p>

<p>Now, you can also just use specific widths and heights for everything, if
you want. That’ll take some math, but everything could be perfect.</p>

<p>Generally, I’d suggest using stacks and flows. The idea here is that you
want to fill up a certain width with things, then advance down the page,
filling up further widths. You can think of these as being analogous to
HTML’s “block” and “inline” styles.</p>

<h4 id="label-Stacks+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Stacks ====</h4>

<p>A stack is simply a vertical stack of elements. Each element in a stack is
placed directly under the element preceding it.</p>

<p>A stack is also shaped like a box. So if a stack is given a width of 250,
that stack is itself an element which is 250 pixels wide.</p>

<p>To create a new stack, use the [[Element.stack]] method, which is available
inside any slot.  So stacks can contain other stacks and flows.</p>

<h4 id="label-Flows+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Flows ====</h4>

<p>A flow will pack elements in as tightly as it can. A width will be filled,
then will wrap beneath those elements. Text elements placed next to each
other will appear as a single paragraph. Images and widgets will run
together as a series.</p>

<p>Like the stack, a flow is a box. So stacks and flows can safely be embedded
and, without respect to their contents, are identical. They just treat
their contents differently.</p>

<p>Making a flow means calling the [[Element.flow]] method.  Flows may contain
other flows and stacks.</p>

<p>Last thing: The Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> window
itself is a flow.</p>

<h2 id="label-Art+for+Slots+%3D%3D">Art for Slots ==</h2>

<p>Each slot is like a canvas, a blank surface which can be covered with an
assortment of colored shapes or gradients.</p>

<p>Many common shapes can be drawn with methods like `oval` and `rect`. 
You’ll need to set up the paintbrush colors first, though.</p>

<p>The `stroke` command sets the line color.  And the `fill` command sets the
color used to paint inside the lines.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stroke red
  fill blue
  oval top: 10, left: 10, radius: 100
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>That code gives you a blue pie with a red line around it.  One-hundred
pixels wide, placed just a few pixels southeast of the window’s upper left
corner.</p>

<p>The `blue` and `red` methods above are RGB array.  See the section on
Colors for more on how to mix colors.</p>

<h4 id="label-Inspiration+from+Processing+and+NodeBox+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Inspiration from Processing and NodeBox ====</h4>

<p>The artful methods generally come verbatim from NodeBox, a drawing kit for
Python.  In turn, NodeBox gets much of its ideas from Processing, a
Java-like language for graphics and animation.  I owe a great debt to the
creators of these wonderful programs!</p>

<p>Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> does a few things
differently from NodeBox and Processing.  For example, Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has different color methods,
including having its own RGB array, though these are very similar to
Processing’s color methods.  And Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also allows images and gradients
to be used for drawing lines and filling in shapes.</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also borrows some animation
ideas from Processing and will continue to closely consult Processing’s
methods as it expands.</p>

<h3 id="label-arc%28left%2C+top%2C+width%2C+height%2C+angle1%2C+angle2%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AOval+%3D%3D%3D">arc(left, top, width, height, angle1, angle2) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Oval.html">Shoes::Oval</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draws an arc shape (a section of an oval) at coordinates (left, top).  This
method just give you a bit more control than [[oval]], by offering the
`:angle1` and `:angle2` styles.  (In fact, you can mimick the `oval` method
by setting `:angle1` to 0 and `:angle2` to `2*Math::PI`.)</p>

<p>Describes an arbitrary shape to draw, beginning at coordinates (left, top)
and continued by calls to `line_to`, `move_to`, `curve_to` and `arc_to`

<h2 id="label-Events+%3D%3D">Events ==</h2>

<p>Wondering how to catch stray mouse clicks or keyboard typing?  Events are
sent to a slot whenever a mouse moves inside the slot.  Or whenever a key
is pressed.  Even when the slot is created or destroyed.  You can attach a
block to each of these events.</p>

<p>Mouse events include `motion`, `click`, `release`, `hover` and `leave`. 
Keyboard typing is represented by the `keypress` event.  And the `start`
and `finish` events indicate when a canvas comes into play or is discarded.</p>

<p>So, let’s say you want to change the background of a slot whenever the
mouse floats over it.  We can use the `hover` event to change the
background when the mouse comes inside the slot.  And `leave` to change
back when the mouse floats away.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  s = stack width: 200, height: 200 do
    background red
  end
  s.hover do

    s.clear { background red }

<p>The click block is called when a mouse button is clicked.  The `button` is
the number of the mouse button which has been pressed.  The `left` and
`top` are the mouse coordinates at which the click happened.</p>

<p>To catch the moment when the mouse is unclicked, see the [[Events.release]]
event.</p>

<h3 id="label-finish+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">finish { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When a slot is removed, it’s finish event occurs.  The finish block is
immediately handed `self`, the slot object which has been removed.</p>

<p>”‘Note:”’ Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> doesn’t
support `finish` method.</p>

<h3 id="label-hover+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">hover { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>The hover event happens when the mouse enters the slot.  The block gets
`self`, meaning the object which was hovered over.</p>

<p>To catch the mouse exiting the slot, check out the [[Events.leave]] event.</p>

<h3 id="label-keypress+%7B+%7Ckey%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">keypress { |key| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Whenever a key (or combination of keys) is pressed, the block gets called. 
The block is sent a `key` which is a string representing the character
(such as the letter or number) on the key.</p>

<p>So, for example, if `Shift-a` is pressed, the block will get the string
`“Shift_L”` and `“A”`.</p>

<p>And if the `F1` key is pressed, the `“F1”` string is received.</p>

<p>The left side modifier keys are `“Control_L”`, `“Shift_L”` and `“Alt_L”`. 
They appear in that order. If `Shift-Control-Alt-PgUp` is pressed, the
strings will be `“Shift_L”`, `“Control_L”`, `“Alt_L”` and `“Page_Up”`.</p>

<p>One thing about the shift key.  On US keyboards, `Shift-7` is an ampersand.
So you’ll get the string `“Shift_L”` and `“ampersand”` rather than
`“Shift_L”` and `“7”`.  And, if you press `Shift-Alt-7` on such a keyboard,
you’ll get the strings: `“Shift_L”`, `“Alt_L”` and `“ampersand”`.</p>

Displacing is a handy way of moving a slot without altering the layout.  In
fact, the `top` and `left` methods will not report displacement at all. 
So, generally, displacement is only for temporary animations.  For example,
jiggling a button in place.</p>

<p>The `left` and `top` numbers sent to `displace` are added to the slot’s own
top-left coordinates.  To subtract from the top-left coordinate, use
negative numbers.</p>

<h3 id="label-gutter%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">gutter() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The size of the scrollbar area.  When Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> needs to show a scrollbar, the
scrollbar may end up covering up some elements that touch the edge of the
window.  The `gutter` tells you how many pixels to expect the scrollbar to
cover.</p>

<p>This is commonly used to pad elements on the right, like so:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  stack margin_right: 20 + gutter do
    para &quot;Insert fat and ratified &quot;,
      &quot;declaration of independence here...&quot;

<p>}}}</p>

<h3 id="label-height%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">height() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The vertical size of the viewable slot in pixels.  So, if this is a
scrolling slot, you’ll need to use `scroll_height()` to get the full size
of the slot.</p>

<h3 id="label-hide%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">hide() » self ===</h3>

[[Position.toggle]].</p>

<h3 id="label-left%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">left() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The left pixel location of the slot.  Also known as the x-axis coordinate.</p>

<h3 id="label-move%28left%2C+top%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">move(left, top) » self ===</h3>

<h3 id="label-scroll_max%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">scroll_max() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The top coordinate which this slot can be scrolled down to.  The top
coordinate of a scroll bar is always zero.  The bottom coordinate is the
full height of the slot minus one page of scrolling.  This bottom
coordinate is what `scroll_max` returns.</p>

<p>This is basically a shortcut for writing `slot.scroll_height -
slot.height`.</p>

<p>To scroll to the bottom of a slot, use `slot.scroll_top = slot.scroll_max`.</p>

<h3 id="label-style%28%29+%C2%BB+styles+%3D%3D%3D">style() » styles ===</h3>

<p>Calling the `style` method with no arguments returns a hash of the styles
presently applied to this slot.</p>

<p>While methods such as `height` and `width` return the true pixel dimensions
of the slot, you can use `<a href="http://:height">style</a>` or `<a

<p>You may find yourself needing to loop through the elements inside a slot.

of an element.</p>

<p>On any element, you may call the `parent` method to get the slot directly

<h1 id="label-Elements+%3D">Elements =</h1>

<p>Ah, here’s the stuff of Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.
An element can be as simple as an oval shape. Or as complex as a para text
string. You’ve encountered all of these elements before in the Slots
section of the manual.</p>

<p>Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has seven native
controls: the Button, the EditLine, the EditBox, the ListBox, the Progress
meter, the Check box and the Radio.  By “native” controls, we mean that
each of these seven elements is drawn by Ruby/GTK2 apis  directly.  So, a
Progress bar will never convert to the PNG image data.</p>

<p>Greem <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also has seven basic
other types of elements: Background, Border, Image, Shape, TextBlock,
Animate and Video.  These all should look and act the same on every
operating system.</p>

<p>Once an element is created, you will often still want to change it. To move
it or hide it or get rid of it. You’ll use the commands in this section to
do that sort of stuff. (Especially check out the [[Common Common Methods]]
section for commands you can use on any element.)</p>

<p>So, for example, use the `image` method to place a PNG on the screen. The
`image` method gives you back an Image object. Use the methods of the Image
object to change things up.</p>

<h2 id="label-Common+Methods+%3D%3D">Common Methods ==</h2>

<p>A few methods are shared by every little element in Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  Moving, showing, hiding. 
Removing an element.  Basic and very general things.  This list encompasses
those common commands.</p>

<p>One of the most general methods of all is the `style` method (which is also
covered as the [[Position.style]] method for slots.)</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    # Background, text and a button: 
    # both are elements!
    @back  = background green
    @text  = banner &quot;A Message for You, Rudy&quot;
    @press = button &quot;Stop your messin about!&quot;

    # And so, both can be styled.
    @text.style size: 12, 
      markup: fg(@text.text, red), margin: 10
    @press.style width: 400
    @back.style height: 10
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>For specific commands, see the other links to the left in the Elements
section. Like if you want to pause or play a video file, check the
[[Video]] section, since pausing and playing is peculiar to videos.  No
sense pausing a button.</p>

<h3 id="label-displace%28left%3A+a+number%2C+top%3A+a+number%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">displace(left: a number, top: a number) » self ===</h3>

<p>Displacing an element moves it.  But without changing the layout around it.
This is great for subtle animations, especially if you want to reserve a
place for an element while it is still animating.  Like maybe a quick
button shake or a slot sliding into view.</p>

<p>When you displace an element, it moves relative to the upper-left corner
where it was placed.  So, if an element is at the coordinates (20, 40) and
you displace it 2 pixels left and 6 pixels on top, you end up with the
coordinates (22, 46).</p>

<h2 id="label-Background+%3D%3D">Background ==</h2>

<p>A background is a color, a gradient or an image that is painted across an
entire slot.  Both backgrounds and borders are a type of <a
href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a>. !{:margin_left
=&gt; 100}man-ele-background.png!</p>

<p>Even though it’s called a ”background”, you may still place this element in
front of other elements.  If a background comes after something else
painted on the slot (like a `rect` or an `oval`,) the background will be
painted over that element.</p>

<p>The simplest background is just a plain color background, created with the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Element.background]
<dd>
<p>method, such as this black background:</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  background black
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>A simple background like that paints the entire slot that contains it.  (In
this case, the whole window is painted black.)</p>

<p>You can use styles to cut down the size or move around the background to
your liking.</p>

<p>To paint a black background across the top fifty pixels of the window:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  background black, height: 50
end</pre>

<p>Or, to paint a fifty pixel column on the left-side of the window:</p>

<p>Yanks out the color, gradient or image used to paint this background and

then pass that object to other backgrounds and borders.  Reuse it as you

<h2 id="label-Border+%3D%3D">Border ==</h2>

<p>A border is a color, gradient or image painted in a line around the edge of
any slot.  Like the Background element in the last section, a Border is a
kind of <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a>.
!{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-border.png!</p>

<p>The first, crucial thing to know about border is that all borders paint a
line around the ”‘inside”’ of a slot, not the outside.  So, if you have a
slot which is fifty pixels wide and you paint a five pixel border on it,
that means there is a fourty pixel wide area inside the slot which is
surrounded by the border.</p>

<p>This also means that if you paint a Border on top of a [[Background]], the
edges of the background will be painted over by the border.</p>

<p>Here is just such a slot:</p>

end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>If you want to paint a border around the outside of a slot, you’ll need to
wrap that slot in another slot.  Then, place the border in the outside
slot.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack width: 60 do
    border black, strokewidth: 5
    stack width: 50 do
      para fg &quot;=^.^=&quot;, green
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>In HTML and many other languages, the border is painted on the outside of
the box, thus increasing the overall width of the box.  Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> was designed with consistency in
mind, so that if you say that a box is fifty pixels wide, it stays fifty
pixels wide regardless of its borders or margins or anything else.</p>

<p>Please also check out the [[Elements]] section for other methods used on
borders.</p>

<h3 id="label-to_pattern%28%29+%C2%BB+a+Shoes%3A%3APattern+%3D%3D%3D">to_pattern() » a <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a> ===</h3>

<p>Creates a basic pattern object based on the color, gradient or image used
to paint this border.  The pattern may then be re-used in new borders and
backgrounds.</p>

<p>”‘Note:”’ Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> doesn’t
support `to_pattern` method.</p>

<h2 id="label-Button+%3D%3D">Button ==</h2>

<p>Buttons are, you know, push buttons.  You click them and they do something.
Buttons are known to say “OK” or “Are you sure?”  And, then, if you’re
sure, you click the button. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-button.png!</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  button &quot;OK!&quot;
  button &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>The buttons in the example above don’t do anything when you click them. In
order to get them to work, you’ve got to hook up a block to each button.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  button &quot;OK!&quot; do
    append { para &quot;Well okay then.&quot; }
  end
  button &quot;Are you sure?&quot; do
    append { para &quot;Your confidence is inspiring.&quot; }
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So now we’ve got blocks for the buttons. Each block appends a new paragraph
to the page. The more you click, the more paragraphs get added.</p>

<p>It doesn’t go much deeper than that. A button is just a clickable phrase.</p>

<p>Just to be pedantic, though, here’s another way to write that last example.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  @b1 = button &quot;OK!&quot;
  @b1.click{para &quot;Well okay then.&quot;}
  @b2 = button &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
  @b2.click{para &quot;Your confidence is inspiring.&quot;}
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This looks dramatically different, but it does the same thing.  The first
difference: rather than attaching the block directly to the button, the
block is attached later, through the `click` method.</p>

<p>The second change isn’t related to buttons at all.  The `append` block was
dropped since Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> allows you
to add new elements directly to the slot.  So we can just call `para`
directly.  (This isn’t the case with the `prepend`, `before` or `after`
methods.)</p>

<p>Beside the methods below, buttons also inherit all of the methods that are
[[Common]].</p>

<h3 id="label-click%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">click() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When a button is clicked, its `click` block is called.  The block is handed
`self`.  Meaning: the button which was clicked.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the button.  The button will be highlighted and, if the user
hits Enter, the button will be clicked.</p>

<h2 id="label-Check+%3D%3D">Check ==</h2>

<p>Check boxes are clickable square boxes than can be either checked or
unchecked. A single checkbox usually asks a “yes” or “no” question.  Sets
of checkboxes are also seen in to-do lists. !{:margin_left =&gt;
100}man-ele-check.png!</p>

<p>Here’s a sample checklist.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    flow do
      check; para &quot;Frances Johnson&quot;, width: 200
    end
    flow do
      check; para &quot;Ignatius J. Reilly&quot;, width: 200
    end
    flow do
      check
      para &quot;Winston Niles Rumfoord&quot;, width: 200
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>You basically have two ways to use a check.  You can attach a block to the
check and it’ll get called when the check gets clicked.  And/or you can
just use the `checked?` method to go back and see if a box has been checked
or not.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s add to the above example.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment">#!ruby</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So, when the button gets pressed, each of the checks gets asked for its
status, using the `checked?` method.</p>

<p>Button methods are listed below, but also see the list of [[Common]]
methods, which all elements respond to.</p>

<h3 id="label-checked%3F%28%29+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked?() » true or false ===</h3>

<p>Returns whether the box is checked or not.  So, `true` means “yes, the box
is checked!”</p>

<h3 id="label-checked+%3D+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked = true or false ===</h3>

<p>Marks or unmarks the check box.  Using `checked = false`, for instance,
unchecks the box.</p>

<h3 id="label-click%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">click() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When the check is clicked, its `click` block is called.  The block is
handed `self`, which is the check object which was clicked.</p>

<p>Clicks are sent for both checking and unchecking the box.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the check.  The check will be highlighted and, if the user
hits Enter, the check will be toggled between its checked and unchecked
states.</p>

<h2 id="label-EditBox+%3D%3D">EditBox ==</h2>

<p>Edit boxes are wide, rectangular boxes for entering text.  On the web, they
call these textareas.  These are multi-line edit boxes for entering longer
descriptions.  Essays, even! !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-editbox.png!</p>

<p>Without any other styling, edit boxes are sized 200 pixels by 108 pixels. 
You can also use `:width` and `:height` styles to set specific sizes.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  edit_box
  edit_box width: 100, height: 100
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Other controls (like [[Button]] and [[Check]]) have only click events, but
both</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[EditLine]
<dd>
<p>and EditBox have a `change` event.  The `change` block is called</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>every time someone types into or deletes from the box.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment">#!ruby</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">edit_box</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">e</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>

<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Notice that the example also uses the [[EditBox.text]] method inside the
block. That method gives you a string of all the characters typed into the
box.</p>

<p>More edit box methods are listed below, but also see the list of [[Common]]
methods, which all elements respond to.</p>

<h3 id="label-change%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">change() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Each time a character is added to or removed from the edit box, its
`change` block is called. The block is given `self`, which is the edit box
object which has changed.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the edit box. The edit box will be highlighted and the user
will be able to type into the edit box.</p>

<h3 id="label-text%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">text() » self ===</h3>

<p>Return a string of characters which have been typed into the box.</p>

<h3 id="label-text+%3D+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">text = a string ===</h3>

<p>Fills the edit box with the characters of `a string`.</p>

<h2 id="label-EditLine+%3D%3D">EditLine ==</h2>

<p>Edit lines are a slender, little box for entering text. While the EditBox
is multi-line, an edit line is just one. Line, that is. Horizontal, in
fact. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-editline.png!</p>

<p>The unstyled edit line is 200 pixels wide and 28 pixels wide. Roughly. The
height may vary on some platforms.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    edit_line
    edit_line width: 400
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>You can change the size by styling both the `:width` and the `:height`.
However, you generally only want to style the `:width`, as the height will
be sized to fit the font. (And, in current versions of Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, the font for edit lines and edit
boxes cannot be altered anyway.)</p>

<p>If a block is given to an edit line, it receives `change` events. Check out
the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[EditBox]
<dd>
<p>page for an example of using a change block. In fact, the edit box</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>has all the same methods as an edit line. Also see the list of [[Common]]
methods, which all elements respond to.</p>

<h3 id="label-change%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">change() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Each time a character is added to or removed from the edit line, its
`change` block is called. The block is given `self`, which is the edit line
object which has changed.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the edit line. The edit line will be highlighted and the
user will be able to type into the edit line.</p>

<h3 id="label-text%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">text() » self ===</h3>

<p>Return a string of characters which have been typed into the box.</p>

<h3 id="label-text+%3D+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">text = a string ===</h3>

<p>Fills the edit line with the characters of `a string`.</p>

<h2 id="label-Image+%3D%3D">Image ==</h2>

<p>An image is a picture in PNG, JPEG or GIF format. Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> can resize images or flow them in
with text. Images can be loaded from a file or directly off the web.
!{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-image.png!</p>

<p>To create an image, use the `image` method in a slot:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  para &quot;Nice, nice, very nice.  Busy, busy, busy.&quot;
  image File.join DIR,
    &quot;../static/shoes-manual-apps.png&quot;
 end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>When you load any image into Green <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, it is cached in memory. This
means that if you load up many image elements from the same file, it’ll
only really load the file once.</p>

<p>You can use web URLs directly as well.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  image &quot;http://is.gd/c0mBtb&quot;
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>When an image is loaded from the web, it’s cached on the hard drive as well
as in memory. This prevents a repeat download unless the image has changed.
(In case you’re wondering: <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>
keeps track of modification times and etags just like a browser would.)</p>

<p>”‘Note:”’ Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> doesn’t
support the hard drive cache management feature like Red <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.</p>

<p>Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also loads remote images
in the background using system threads. So, using remote images will not
block Ruby or any intense graphical displays you may have going on.</p>

<h3 id="label-full_height%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">full_height() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The full pixel height of the image. Normally, you can just use the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Common.height]
<dd>
<p>method to figure out how many pixels high the image is. But</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>if you’ve resized the image or styled it to be larger or something, then
`height` will return the scaled size.</p>

<p>The `full_height` method gives you the height of image (in pixels) as it
was stored in the original file.</p>

<h3 id="label-full_width%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">full_width() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The full pixel width of the image. See the [[Image.full_height]] method for
an explanation of why you might use this method rather than
[[Common.width]].</p>

<h3 id="label-path%28%29+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">path() » a string ===</h3>

<p>The URL or file name of the image.</p>

<h3 id="label-path+%3D+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">path = a string ===</h3>

<p>Swaps the image with a different one, loaded from a file or URL.</p>

<h2 id="label-ListBox+%3D%3D">ListBox ==</h2>

<p>List boxes (also called “combo boxes” or “drop-down boxes” or “select
boxes” in some places) are a list of options that drop down when you click
on the box. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-listbox.png!</p>

<p>A list box gets its options from an array.  An array (a list) of strings,
passed into the `:items` style.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So, the basic size of a list box is about 200 pixels wide and 28 pixels
high. You can adjust this length using the `:width` style.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Next to the `:width` style, the example uses another useful option. The
`:choose` option tells the list box which of the items should be
highlighted from the beginning. (There’s also a [[ListBox.choose]] method
for highlighting an item after the box is created.)</p>

<p>List boxes also have a [[ListBox.change]] event. In the last example, we’ve
got a block hooked up to the list box. Well, okay, see, that’s a `change`
block. The block is called each time someone changes the selected item.</p>

<p>Those are the basics. Might you also be persuaded to look at the [[Common]]
methods page, a complete list of the methods that all elements have?</p>

<h3 id="label-change%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">change() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Whenever someone highlights a new option in the list box (by clicking on an
item, for instance,) its `change` block is called. The block is given
`self`, which is the list box object which has changed.</p>

<h3 id="label-choose%28item%3A+a+string%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">choose(item: a string) » self ===</h3>

<p>Selects the option in the list box that matches the string given by `item`.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the list box. The list box will be highlighted and, if the
user hits the up and down arrow keys, other options in the list will be
selected.</p>

<h3 id="label-items%28%29+%C2%BB+an+array+of+strings+%3D%3D%3D">items() » an array of strings ===</h3>

<p>Returns the complete list of strings that the list box presently shows as
its options.</p>

<h3 id="label-items+%3D+an+array+of+strings+%3D%3D%3D">items = an array of strings ===</h3>

<p>A string containing whatever text is shown highlighted in the list box
right now. If nothing is selected, `nil` will be the reply.</p>

<h2 id="label-Progress+%3D%3D">Progress ==</h2>

<p>Progress bars show you how far along you are in an activity. Usually, a
progress bar represents a percentage (from 0% to 100%.) Green <a

the decimal numbers 0.0 to 1.0. !{:margin_left =&gt;
100}man-ele-progress.png!</p>

<p>A simple progress bar is 150 pixels wide, but you can use the `:width`
style (as with all Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>
elements) to lengthen it.</p>

<p>Take a look at the [[Common]] methods page for a list of methods found an
all elements, including progress bars.</p>

<h3 id="label-fraction%28%29+%C2%BB+a+decimal+number+%3D%3D%3D">fraction() » a decimal number ===</h3>

<p>Returns a decimal number from 0.0 to 1.0, indicating how far along the
progress bar is.</p>

<h3 id="label-fraction+%3D+a+decimal+number+%3D%3D%3D">fraction = a decimal number ===</h3>

<p>Sets the progress to a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>

<h2 id="label-Radio+%3D%3D">Radio ==</h2>

<p>Radio buttons are a group of clickable circles. Click a circle and it’ll be
marked. Only one radio button can be marked at a time. (This is similar to
the ListBox, where only one option can be selected at a time.)
!{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-radio.png!</p>

<p>So, how do you decide when to use radio buttons and when to use list boxes?
Well, list boxes only show one highlighted item unless you click on the box
and the drop-down appears. But radio buttons are all shown, regardless of
which is marked.</p>

    &quot; by Majid Majidi\n&quot;, width: 570
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Only one of these three radios can be checked at a time, since they are
grouped together in the same slot (along with a bunch of `para`.)</p>

<p>If we move them each into their own slot, the example breaks.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para &quot;Among these films, which do you prefer?&quot;
    flow do
      radio
      para &quot;The Taste of Tea by Katsuhito Ishii&quot;, 
        width: 300
    end
    flow do
      radio
      para &quot;Kin-Dza-Dza by Georgi Danelia&quot;,

        width: 300
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This can be fixed, though. You can group together radios from different
slots, you just have to give them all the same group name.</p>

<p>Here, let’s group all these radios in the `:films` group.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

    para &quot;Among these films, which do you prefer?&quot;

<p>For more methods beyond those listed below, also look into the [[Common]]
methods page. Because you get those methods on every radio as well.</p>

<h3 id="label-checked%3F%28%29+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked?() » true or false ===</h3>

<p>Returns whether the radio button is checked or not. So, `true` means “yes,
it is checked!”</p>

<h3 id="label-checked+%3D+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked = true or false ===</h3>

<p>Marks or unmarks the radio button. Using `checked = false`, for instance,
clears the radio.</p>

<h3 id="label-click%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">click() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When the radio button is clicked, its `click` block is called. The block is
handed `self`, which is an object representing the radio which was clicked.</p>

<p>Clicks are sent for both marking and unmarking the radio.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the radio. The radio will be highlighted.</p>

<h2 id="label-Shape+%3D%3D">Shape ==</h2>

<p>A shape is a path outline usually created by drawing methods like `oval`
and `rect`. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-shape.png!</p>

<p>See the [[Common]] methods page.  Shapes respond to all of those methods.</p>

<h2 id="label-TextBlock+%3D%3D">TextBlock ==</h2>

<p>The TextBlock object represents a group of text organized as a single
element. A paragraph containing bolded text, for example. A caption
containing links and bolded text. (So, a `caption` is a TextBlock type. 
However, `link` and `strong` are Text types.) !{:margin_left =&gt;
100}man-ele-textblock.png!</p>

<p>All of the various types of TextBlock are found on the [[Element Element
Creation]] page.</p>

<pre>* [[Element.banner]], a 48 pixel font.
* [[Element.title]], a 34 pixel font.
* [[Element.subtitle]], a 26 pixel font.
* [[Element.tagline]], an 18 pixel font.
* [[Element.caption]], a 14 pixel font.
* [[Element.para]], a 12 pixel font.
* [[Element.inscription]], a 10 pixel font.</pre>

<h3 id="label-contents%28%29+%C2%BB+an+array+of+elements++%3D%3D%3D">contents() » an array of elements  ===</h3>

<p>Lists all of the strings and styled text objects inside this block.</p>

<p>”‘Note:”’ Green <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> doesn’t
support `contents` method.</p>

<h3 id="label-cursor%28%29+%C2%BB+an+index+%3D%3D%3D">cursor() » an index ===</h3>

<p>Return a text cursor position. That is an index of the text which is a
string of all of the characters in this text box.</p>

<h3 id="label-cursor+%3D+an+index+or+nil+%3D%3D%3D">cursor = an index or nil ===</h3>

<p>Shows or hides the text cursor. Using `cursor = 3`, for instance, shows the
text cursor at index 3 from the front. Using `cursor = -1` shows the text
cursor at the end of the text. Using `cursor = nil` hides the text cursor.</p>

the animate, every and timer. Both animate and every loop over and over
after they start.  The timer happens once. A one-shot timer.</p>

<p>The animate and every are basically the same thing. The difference is that
the animate usually happen many, many times per second. And the every
happens only once every few seconds or rarely.</p>

<p>The animate and every automatically start themselves.</p>

<h3 id="label-start%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">start() » self ===</h3>
