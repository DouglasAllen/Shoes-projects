<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is a tiny graphics toolkit.
It’s simple and straightforward. <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> was born to be easy!  Really, it
was made for absolute beginners. There’s really nothing to it.</p>

<p>You see, the trivial <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> program
can be just one line:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app { button(&quot;Click me!&quot;) { alert(&quot;Good job.&quot;) } }</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs are written in a
language called Ruby.  When <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is
handed this simple line of Ruby code, a window appears with a button inside
reading “Click me!”  When the button is clicked, a message pops up.</p>

<p>On Linux, here’s how this might look: !{:margin_left =&gt;
100}man-shot1.png!</p>

<p>While lots of <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> apps are
graphical games and art programs, you can also layout text and edit
controls easily. !{:margin_left =&gt; 40}shoes-manual-apps.gif!</p>

<p>And, ideally, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs will
run on any of the major platforms out there. Microsoft Windows, Apple’s Mac
OS X, Linux and many others.</p>

<p>^So, welcome to Shoes’ built-in manual. This manual is a <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> program itself!^</p>

<h2 id="label-Introducing+Shoes+%3D%3D">Introducing <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ==</h2>

<p>How does <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> look on OS X and
Windows? Does it really look okay? Is it all ugly and awkward? People must
immediately convulse! It must be so watered down trying to do everything.</p>

<p>Well, before getting into the stuff about installing and running <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, time to just check out some
screenshots, to give you an idea of what you can do.</p>

<h4 id="label-Mac+OS+X+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Mac OS X ====</h4>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> runs on Apple Mac OS X
Leopard, as well as Tiger.  <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>
supports PowerPC machines as well, however, there is no video support on
that platform. !man-look-tiger.png!</p>

<p>This is the `simple-sphere.rb` sample running on Tiger.  Notice that the
app runs inside a normal OS X window border.</p>

<p>The whole sphere is drawn with blurred ovals and shadows. You can draw and
animate shapes and apply effects to those shapes in <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.</p>

<h4 id="label-Windows+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Windows ====</h4>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> runs on all versions of
”‘Microsoft Windows XP”’, ”‘Windows Vista”’, ”‘Windows 7”’, and anything
else ”‘Windows 2000”’ compatible. !man-look-vista.png!</p>

<p>Above is pictured the `simple-clock.rb` sample running on Windows Vista.
This example is also draws ovals and lines to build the clock, which is
animated to repaint itself several times each second.</p>

<p>Notice the text on the top of the app, showing the current time. <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has the skills to layout words
using any color, bold, italics, underlines, and supports loading fonts from
a file.</p>

<h4 id="label-Linux+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Linux ====</h4>

<p>Here’s a screenshot of the `simple-downloader.rb` sample running on
”‘Ubuntu Linux”’. !man-look-ubuntu.png!</p>

<p>Notice the buttons and progress bars. These types of controls look
different on OS X and Windows. The text and links would look the same,
though.</p>

<p>Shapes, text, images and videos all look the same on every platforms. 
However, native controls (like edit lines and edit boxes) will match the
look of the window theme. <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> will
try to keep native controls all within the size you give them, only the
look will vary.</p>

<h2 id="label-Installing+Shoes+%3D%3D">Installing <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ==</h2>

<p>Okay, on to installing <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>. I’m
sure you’re wondering: do I need to install Ruby? Do I need to unzip
anything? What commands do I need to type?</p>

<p>Nope. You don’t need Ruby. You don’t need WinZip. Nothing to type.</p>

<p>On most systems, starting <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is
just a matter of running the installer and clicking the <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> icon.  <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> comes with everything built in.
We’ll talk through all the steps, though, just to be clear about it.</p>

<h4 id="label-Step+1%3A+Installing+Shoes+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Step 1: Installing <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ====</h4>

<p>You’ll want to visit [[<a href="http://shoesrb.com/">shoesrb.com/</a> the
site of Shoes]] to download the <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> installer.  Usually, you’ll just
want one of the installers on the downloads page of the site.
!man-builds1.png!</p>

<p>Here’s how to run the installer:</p>

<pre>* On '''Mac OS X''', you'll have a file ending with '''.dmg'''.  Double-click this file and a window should appear with a '''Shoes''' icon and an '''Applications''' folder.  Following the arrow, drag the Shoes icon into the '''Applications''' folder. !man-intro-dmg.png!
* On '''Windows''', you'll download a '''.exe''' file.  Double-click this file and follow the instructions. !man-intro-exe.png!
* On '''Linux''', you'll need to compile your own Shoes. Check out [[https://github.com/shoes/shoes/wiki/Building-Shoes-on-Linux this page]] for more. We want to provide packages eventually!</pre>

<h4 id="label-Step+2%3A+Start+a+New+Text+File+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Step 2: Start a New Text <a href="../../classes/File.html">File</a> ====</h4>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs are just plain text
files ending with a ”‘.rb”’ extension.</p>

<p>Here are a few ways to create a blank text file:</p>

<pre>* On '''Mac OS X''', visit your '''Applications''' folder and double-click on the '''TextEdit''' app.  A blank editor window should come up.  Now, go to the '''Format''' menu and select the '''Make Plain Text''' option.  Okay, you're all set! !man-editor-osx.png!
* On '''Windows''', go to the Start menu.  Select '''All Programs''', then '''Accessories''', then '''Notepad'''. !man-editor-notepad.png!
* On '''Linux''', most distros come with '''gedit'''.  You might try running that.  Or, if your distro is KDE-based, run '''kate'''.</pre>

<p>Now, in your blank window, type in the following:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  background &quot;#DFA&quot;
  para &quot;Welcome to Shoes&quot;
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Save to your desktop as `welcome.rb`.</p>

<h4 id="label-Step+3%3A+Run+It%21+Go+Shoes%21+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Step 3: Run It! Go <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>! ====</h4>

<p>To run your program:</p>

<pre>* On '''Mac OS X''', visit your '''Applications''' folder again.  This time, double-click the '''Shoes''' icon in that folder.  You should see the red shoes icon appear in the dock.  Drag your `welcome.rb` from the desktop on to that dock icon. !man-run-osx.png!
* On '''Windows''', get to the Start menu.  Go into '''All Programs''', then '''Shoes''', then '''Shoes'''.  A file selector box should come up.  Browse to your desktop and select `welcome.rb`.  Click '''OK''' and you're on your way. !man-run-xp.png! !man-run-vista.png!
* On '''Linux''', run Shoes just like you did in step one.  You should see a file selector box.  Browse to your desktop, select `welcome.rb` and hit '''OK'''.</pre>

<p>So, not much of a program yet.  But it’s something!  You’ve got the knack
of it, at least!</p>

<h4 id="label-What+Can+You+Make+With+Shoes%3F+%3D%3D%3D%3D">What Can You <a href="../../classes/Make.html">Make</a> With <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>? ====</h4>

<p>Well, you can make windowing applications. But <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is inspired by the web, so
applications tend to use images and text layout rather than a lot of
widgets. For example, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> doesn’t
come with tabbed controls or toolbars. <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is a ”tiny” toolkit, remember?</p>

<p>Still, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> does have a few widgets
like buttons and edit boxes. And many missing elements (like tabbed
controls or toolbars) can be simulated with images.</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is written in part thanks to a
very good art engine called Cairo, which is used for drawing with shapes
and colors. In this way, <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is
inspired by NodeBox and Processing, two very good languages for drawing
animated graphics.</p>

<h2 id="label-The+Rules+of+Shoes+%3D%3D">The Rules of <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> ==</h2>

<p><a href="../../classes/Time.html">Time</a> to stop guessing how <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> works.  Some of the tricky things
will come back to haunt you.  I’ve boiled down the central rules to <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  These are the things you MUST
know to really make it all work.</p>

<p>These are general rules found throughout <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  While <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has an overall philosophy of
simplicity and clarity, there are a few points that need to be studied and
remembered.</p>

<h4 id="label-Shoes+Tricky+Blocks+%3D%3D%3D%3D"><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> Tricky Blocks ====</h4>

<p>Okay, this is absolutely crucial.  <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> does a trick with blocks.  This
trick makes everything easier to read.  But it also can make blocks harder
to use once you’re in deep.</p>

<p>”‘Let’s take a normal Ruby block:”‘</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">ary</span> = [<span class="ruby-string">'potion'</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'swords'</span>, <span class="ruby-string">'shields'</span>]
<span class="ruby-identifier">ary</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">each</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">item</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">puts</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">item</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>In <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, these sorts of blocks work
the same.  This block above loops through the array and stores each object
in the `item` variable.  The `item` variable disappears (goes out of scope)
when the block ends.</p>

<p>One other thing to keep in mind is that `self` stays the same inside normal
Ruby blocks.  Whatever `self` was before the call to `each`, it is the same
inside the `each` block.</p>

<p>”‘Both of these things are also true for most <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> blocks.”’</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para &quot;First&quot;
    para &quot;Second&quot;
    para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Here we have two blocks.  The first block is sent to `Shoes.app`.  This
`app` block changes `self`.</p>

<p>The other block is the `stack` block.  That block does NOT change self.</p>

<p>”‘For what reason does the `app` block change self?”’  Let’s start by
spelling out that last example completely.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  self.stack do
    self.para &quot;First&quot;
    self.para &quot;Second&quot;
    self.para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>All of the `self`s in the above example are the App object.  <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> uses Ruby’s `instance_eval` to
change self inside the `app` block.  So the method calls to `stack` and
`para` get sent to the app.</p>

<p>”‘This also is why you can use instance variables throughout a <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> app:”’</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  @s = stack do
    @p1 = para &quot;First&quot;
    @p2 = para &quot;Second&quot;
    @p3 = para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>These instance variables will all end up inside the App object.</p>

<p>”‘Whenever you create a new window, `self` is also changed.”’  So, this
means the [[Element.window]] and [[Element.dialog]] methods, in addition to
Shoes.app.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">title</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;MAIN&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">self</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">button</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Spawn&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
    <span class="ruby-identifier">window</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">title</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;CHILD&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
      <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">self</span>
    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<h4 id="label-Block+Redirection+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Block Redirection ====</h4>

<p>The `stack` block is a different story, though.  It doesn’t change `self`
and it’s basically a regular block.</p>

<p>”‘But there’s a trick:”‘ when you attach a `stack` and give it a block, the
App object places that stack in its memory.  The stack gets popped off when
the block ends.  So all drawing inside the block gets ”’redirected”‘ from
the App’s top slot to the new stack.</p>

<p>So those three `para`s will get drawn on the `stack`, even though they
actually get sent to the App object first.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para &quot;First&quot;
    para &quot;Second&quot;
    para &quot;Third&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>A bit tricky, you see?  This can bite you even if you know about it.</p>

<p>One way it’ll get you is if you try to edit a stack somewhere else in your
program, outside the `app` block.</p>

<p>Like let’s say you pass around a stack object.  And you have a class that
edits that object.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Messenger</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">initialize</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span>)
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@stack</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">add</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">msg</span>)
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@stack</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">append</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
      <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">msg</span>
    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So, let’s assume you pass the stack object into your Messenger class when
the app starts.  And, later, when a message comes in, the `add` method gets
used to append a paragraph to that stack.  Should work, right?</p>

<p>Nope, it won’t work.  The `para` method won’t be found.  The App object
isn’t around any more.  And it’s the one with the `para` method.</p>

<p>Fortunately, each <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> object has
an `app` method that will let you reopen the App object so you can do
somefurther editing.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Messenger</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">initialize</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span>)
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@stack</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">def</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">add</span>(<span class="ruby-identifier">msg</span>)
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@stack</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
      <span class="ruby-ivar">@stack</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">append</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
        <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">msg</span>
      <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the `app` method changes `self` to the App object.</p>

<p>So the rules here are:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>”‘Methods named “app” or which create new windows alter `self` to the App</p>
</li></ol>

<p><a href="http://BR">object.”‘[</a>](This is true for both Shoes.app and
Slot.app, as well as</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Element.window]
<dd>
<p>and [[<a href="http://BR">Element.dialog]].)[</a>]</p>
</dd></dl>
<ol><li>
<p>”‘Blocks attached to stacks, flows or any manipulation method (such as</p>
</li></ol>

<p>append) do not change self. Instead, they pop the slot on to the app’s
editing stack.”‘</p>

<h4 id="label-Careful+With+Fixed+Heights+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Careful With Fixed Heights ====</h4>

<p>Fixed widths on slots are great so you can split the window into columns.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Fixed heights on slots should be less common.  Usually you want your text
and images to just flow down the window as far as they can.  Height usually
happens naturally.</p>

<p>The important thing here is that fixed heights actually force slots to
behave differently.  To be sure that the end of the slot is chopped off
perfectly, the slot becomes a ”‘nested window”’.  A new layer is created by
the operating system to keep the slot in a fixed square.</p>

<p>One difference between normal slots and nested window slots is that the
latter can have scrollbars.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">width</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">200</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">height</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">200</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">scroll</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">true</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>These nested windows require more memory.  They tax the application a bit
more. So if you’re experiencing some slowness with hundreds of fixed-height
slots, try a different approach.</p>

<h4 id="label-Image+and+Shape+Blocks+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Image and Shape Blocks ====</h4>

<p>Most beginners start littering the window with shapes.  It’s just easier to
throw all your rectangles and ovals in a slot.</p>

<p>”‘However, bear in mind that <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>
will create objects for all those shapes!”’</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

<p>In this example, one-hundred Oval objects are created.  This isn’t too bad.
But things would be slimmer if we made these into a single shape.</p>

<p>Oh, wait.  The ovals aren’t filled in this time!  That’s because the ovals
have been combined into a single huge shape.  And <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> isn’t sure where to fill in this
case.</p>

<p>So you usually only want to combine into a single shape when you’re dealing
strictly with outlines.</p>

<p>Another option is to combine all those ovals into a single image.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>There we go!  The ovals are all combined into a single 300 x 300 pixel
image. In this case, storing that image in memory might be much bigger than
having one-hundred ovals around.  But when you’re dealing with thousands of
shapes, the image block can be cheaper.</p>

<p>The point is: it’s easy to group shapes together into image or shape
blocks, so give it a try if you’re looking to gain some speed.  Shape
blocks particularly will save you some memory and speed.</p>

<h4 id="label-UTF-8+Everywhere+%3D%3D%3D%3D">UTF-8 Everywhere ====</h4>

<p>Ruby itself isn’t Unicode aware.  And UTF-8 is a type of Unicode.  (See</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8</a> Wikipedia]
<dd>
<p>for a full explanation of</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>UTF-8.)</p>

<p>However, UTF-8 is common on the web.  And lots of different platforms
support it.  So to cut down on the amount of conversion that <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has to do, <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> expects all strings to be in
UTF-8 format.</p>

<p>This is great because you can show a myriad of languages (Russian,
Japanese, Spanish, English) using UTF-8 in <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  Just be sure that your text
editor uses UTF-8!</p>

<p>To illustrate:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">stack</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">margin</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">10</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@edit</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">edit_box</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">width</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">1.0</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
      <span class="ruby-ivar">@para</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">text</span> = <span class="ruby-ivar">@edit</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">text</span>
    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
    <span class="ruby-ivar">@para</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;&quot;</span>
  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This app will copy anything you paste into the edit box and display it in a
<a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> paragraph.  You can try
copying some foreign text (such as Greek or Japanese) into this box to see
how it displays.</p>

<p>This is a good test because it proves that the edit box gives back UTF-8
characters.  And the paragraph can be set to any UTF-8 characters.</p>

<p>”‘Important note:”’ if some UTF-8 characters don’t display for you, you
will need to change the paragraph’s font.  This is especially common on OS
X.</p>

<p>So, a good Japanese font on OS X is ”‘AppleGothic”’ and on Windows is ”‘MS
UI Gothic”’.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>
  <span class="ruby-identifier">para</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;てすと (te-su-to)&quot;</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">font</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">case</span> <span class="ruby-constant">RUBY_PLATFORM</span>

   <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Again, anything which takes a string in <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> will need a UTF-8 string.  Edit
boxes, edit lines, list boxes, window titles and text blocks all take
UTF-8. If you give a string with bad characters in it, an error will show
up in the console.</p>

<h4 id="label-The+Main+App+and+Its+Requires+%3D%3D%3D%3D">The Main App and Its Requires ====</h4>

<p>”‘NOTE:”’ This rule is for Raisins. Policeman uses TOPLEVEL_BINDING. So,
you can get `main`, Ruby top-level object, with the first snippet. Although
you need to use `Shoes::Para` instead of `Para` outside `Shoes.app` block.</p>

<p>Each <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> app is given a little
room where it can create itself.  You can create classes and set variables
and they won’t be seen by other <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs.  Each program runs
inside its own anonymous class.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>main = self
Shoes.app do
  para main.to_s
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This anonymous class is called `(shoes)` and it’s just an empty, unnamed
class. The `Shoes` module is mixed into this class (using `include Shoes`)
so that you can use either `Para` or `Shoes::Para` when referring to the
paragraph class.</p>

<p>The advantages of this approach are:</p>

<pre class="ruby">* <span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">apps</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">cannot</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">share</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">local</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">variables</span>.

</pre>

<p>The second part is especially important to remember.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Storage</span>; <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>The `Storage` class will disappear once the app completes.  Other apps
aren’t able to use the Storage class.  And it can’t be gotten to from files
that are loaded using `require`.</p>

<p>When you `require` code, though, that code will stick around.  It will be
kept in the Ruby top-level environment.</p>

<p>So, the rule is: ”‘keep your temporary classes in the code with the app and
keep your permanent classes in requires.”’</p>

<h1 id="label-Shoes+%3D"><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> =</h1>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is all about drawing windows
and the stuff inside those windows.  Let’s focus on the window itself, for
now.  The other sections [[Slots]] and</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Elements]
<dd>
<p>cover everything that goes inside the window.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>For here on, the manual reads more like a dictionary. Each page is mostly a
list of methods you can use for each topic covered. The idea is to be very
thorough and clear about everything.</p>

<p>So, if you’ve hit this far in the manual and you’re still hazy about
getting started, you should probably either go back to the [[Hello!
beginning]] of the manual. Or you could try [[<a

<h4 id="label-Finding+Your+Way+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Finding Your Way ====</h4>

<p>This section covers:</p>

<pre>* [[Built-in Built-in methods]] - general methods available anywhere in a Shoes program.
* [[App The App window]] - methods found attached to every main Shoes window.
* [[Styles The Styles Master List]] - a complete list of every style in Shoes.
* [[Classes The Classes list]] - a chart showing what Shoes classes subclass what.
* [[Colors The Colors list]] - a chart of all built-in colors and the [[Built-in.rgb]] numbers for each.</pre>

<p>If you find yourself paging around a lot and not finding something, give
the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Search]
<dd>
<p>page a try. It’s the quickest way to get around.</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>After this general reference, there are two other more specific sections:</p>

<pre>* [[Slots]] - covering [[Element.stack]] and [[Element.flow]], the two types of slots.
* [[Elements]] - documentation for all the buttons, shapes, images, and so on.</pre>

<p>Two really important pages in there are the [[Element Element Creation]]
page (which lists all the elements you can add) and the [[Common Common
Methods]] page (which lists methods you’ll find on any slot or element.)</p>

<h2 id="label-Built-in+Methods+%3D%3D">Built-in Methods ==</h2>

<p>These methods can be used anywhere throughout <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> programs.</p>

<p>All of these commands are unusual because you don’t attach them with a dot.
”‘Every other method in this manual must be attached to an object with a
dot.”’ But these are built-in methods (also called: <a
href="../../classes/Kernel.html">Kernel</a> methods.) Which means no dot!</p>

<p>A common one is `alert`:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
alert &quot;No dots in sight&quot;</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Compare that to the method `reverse`, which isn’t a <a

for Arrays and Strings:</p>

<p>Most <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> methods for drawing and

[[Slots]] for more.</p>

<h4 id="label-Built-in+Constants+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Built-in Constants ====</h4>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also has a handful of built-in
constants which may prove useful if you are trying to sniff out what
release of <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> is running.</p>

<p>”‘Shoes::RELEASE_NAME”’ contains a string with the name of the <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> release. All <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> releases are named, starting with
Curious.</p>

<p>”‘Shoes::RELEASE_ID”’ contains a number representing the <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> release.  So, for example,
Curious is number 1, as it was the first official release.</p>

<p>”‘Shoes::REVISION”’ is the Subversion revision number for this build.</p>

<p>”‘Shoes::FONTS”’ is a complete list of fonts available to the app.  This
list includes any fonts loaded by the [[Built-in.font]] method.</p>

<h3 id="label-alert%28message%3A+a+string%29+%C2%BB+nil+%3D%3D%3D">alert(message: a string) » nil ===</h3>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby

<p>Loads a TrueType (or other type of font) from a file.  While TrueType is
supported by all platforms, your platform may support other types of fonts.
<a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> uses each operating system’s
built-in font system to make this work.</p>

<p>Here’s a rough idea of what fonts work on which platforms:</p>

<pre>* Bitmap fonts (.bdf, .pcf, .snf) - Linux
* Font resource (.fon) - Windows
* Windows bitmap font file (.fnt) - Linux, Windows
* PostScript OpenType font (.otf) - Mac OS X, Linux, Windows
* Type1 multiple master (.mmm) - Windows
* Type1 font bits (.pfb) - Linux, Windows
* Type1 font metrics (.pfm) - Linux, Windows
* TrueType font (.ttf) - Mac OS X, Linux, Windows
* TrueType collection (.ttc) - Mac OS X, Linux, Windows</pre>

<p>If the font is properly loaded, you’ll get back an array of font names
found in the file.  Otherwise, `nil` is returned if no fonts were found in
the file.</p>

<p>Also of interest: the `Shoes::FONTS` constant is a complete list of fonts
available to you on this platform.  You can check for a certain font by
using `include?`.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>if Shoes::FONTS.include? &quot;Helvetica&quot;
  alert &quot;Helvetica is available on this system.&quot;
else
  alert &quot;You do not have the Helvetica font.&quot;
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>If you have trouble with fonts showing up, make sure your app loads the
font before it is used.  Especially on OS X, if fonts are used before they
are loaded, the font cache will tend to ignore loaded fonts.</p>

<h3 id="label-gradient%28color1%2C+color2%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3APattern+%3D%3D%3D">gradient(color1, color2) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a> ===</h3>

<h3 id="label-info%28message%3A+a+string%29+%C2%BB+nil+%3D%3D%3D">info(message: a string) » nil ===</h3>

<p>Logs an informational message to the user in the <a

messages are designed to help the program figure out what’s happening,
`info` messages tell the user extra information about the program.</p>

<h3 id="label-rgb%28a+series+of+numbers%3A+red%2C+green%2C+blue%2C+alpha%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AColor+%3D%3D%3D">rgb(a series of numbers: red, green, blue, alpha) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Color.html">Shoes::Color</a> ===</h3>

<p>Create a color from red, green and blue components.  An alpha level
(indicating transparency) can also be added, optionally.</p>

<p>When passing in a whole number, use values from 0 to 255.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>blueviolet = rgb(138, 43, 226)

<p>An App is a single window running code at a URL. When you switch URLs, a

<p>The App is the window itself. Which may be closed or cleared and filled
with new elements. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-app.png!</p>

<p>The App itself, in slot/box terminology, is a flow.  See the ”Slots”
section for more, but this just means that any elements placed directly at
the top-level will flow.</p>

fill the window with various <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>

app or if it’s resizable.</p>

It’s not resizable.  And, inside the window, two elements: a black
background and a white circle.</p>

<p>Once an app is created, it is added to the [[App.<a

<p>And, if we wanted to use the downloaded data, we’d get it using
`goog.response.body`.  This example is truly the simplest form of
`download`: pulling some web data down into memory and handling it once
it’s done.</p>

<p>Another simple use of `download` is to save some web data to a file, using
the `:save` style.</p>

<p>In this case, you can still get the headers for the downloaded file, but
`response.body` will be `nil`, since the data wasn’t saved to memory.  You
will need to open the file to get the downloaded goods.</p>

<p>If you need to send certain headers or actions to the web server, you can
use the `:method`, `:headers` and `:body` styles to customize the HTTP
request. (And, if you need to go beyond these, you can always break out
Ruby’s OpenURI class.)</p>

But if this app was launched using the [[Element.window]] method, the owner

<h3 id="label-started%3F%28%29+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">started?() » true or false ===</h3>

<p>Has the window been fully constructed and displayed?  This is useful for

<p>Absolute URLs (such as <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>) are
okay, but <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> will be expecting a
<a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> application to be at that
address.  (So, google.com won’t work, as it’s an HTML app.)</p>

<h2 id="label-The+Styles+Master+List+%3D%3D">The Styles Master List ==</h2>

<p>You want to mess with the look of things?  Well, throughout <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, styles are used to change the
way elements appear.  In some cases, you can even style an entire class of
elements.  (Like giving all paragraphs a certain font.)</p>

<p>Styles are easy to spot.  They usually show up when the element is created.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Here we’ve got a `:title` style on the app.  And on the paragraph inside
the app, a red `:stroke` style and an `:underline` style.</p>

<p>The style hash can also be changed by using the [[Common.style]] method,
available on every element and slot.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> :<span class="ruby-identifier">title</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;A Styling Sample&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

<p>Most styles can also be set by calling them as methods.  (I’d use the
manual search to find the method.)</p>

<p>Rather than making you plow through the whole manual to figure out what
styles go where, this helpful page speeds through every style in <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> and suggests where that style is
used.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aalign+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:align » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”</p>

<p>The alignment of the text. It is either:</p>

<pre>* &quot;left&quot; - Align the text to the left.
* &quot;center&quot; - Align the text in the center.
* &quot;right&quot; - Align the text to the right.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Aangle+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:angle » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”background, border, gradient”.</p>

<p>The angle at which to apply a gradient.  Normally, gradient colors range
from top to bottom.  If the `:angle` is set to 90, the gradient will rotate
90 degrees counter-clockwise and the gradient will go from left to right.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aattach+%C2%BB+a+slot+or+element+%3D%3D%3D">:attach » a slot or element ===</h3>

<p>For: ”flow, stack”.</p>

<p>Pins a slot relative to another slot or element.  Also, one may write
`:attach</p>

<h1 id="label-%3E+Window%60+to+position+the+slot+at+the+window%27s+top%2C+left+corner.++Taking+this">&gt; Window` to position the slot at the window’s top, left corner.  Taking this</h1>

<p>a bit further, the style `:top =&gt; 10, :left =&gt; 10, :attach =&gt;
Window` would place the slot at (10, 10) in the window’s coordinates.</p>

<p>If a slot is attached to an element that moves, the slot will move with it.
If the attachment is reset to `nil`, the slot will flow in with the other
objects that surround, as normal.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aautoplay+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:autoplay » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”video”.</p>

<p>Should this video begin playing after it appears?  If set to `true`, the
video will start without asking the user.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Abottom+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:bottom » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel coordinate of an element’s lower edge.  The edge is placed
relative to its container’s lower edge.  So, `:bottom =&gt; 0` will align
the element so that its bottom edge and the bottom edge of its slot touch.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Acap+%C2%BB+%3Acurve+or+%3Arect+or+%3Aproject+%3D%3D%3D">:cap » :curve or :rect or :project ===</h3>

<p>For: ”arc, arrow, border, flow, image, mask, rect, star, shape, stack”.</p>

<p>Sets the shape of the line endpoint, whether curved or square.  See the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Art.cap]
<dd>
<p>method for more explanation.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-%3Acenter+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:center » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”arc, image, oval, rect, shape”.</p>

<p>Indicates whether the `:top` and `:left` coordinates refer to the center of
the shape or not.  If set to `true`, this is similar to setting the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Art.transform]
<dd>
<p>method to `:center`.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-%3Achange+%C2%BB+a+proc+%3D%3D%3D">:change » a proc ===</h3>

<p>For: ”edit_box, edit_line, list_box”.</p>

<p>The `change` event handler is stored in this style.  See the
[[EditBox.change]] method for the edit_box, as an example.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Achecked+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:checked » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”check, radio”.</p>

<p>Is this checkbox or radio button checked?  If set to `true`, the box is
checked.  Also see the [[Check.checked=]] method.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Achoose+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:choose » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”list_box”.</p>

<p>Sets the currently chosen item in the list.  More information at
[[ListBox.choose]].</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aclick+%C2%BB+a+proc+%3D%3D%3D">:click » a proc ===</h3>

<p>For: ”arc, arrow, banner, button, caption, check, flow, image, inscription,
line, link, mask, oval, para, radio, rect, shape, stack, star, subtitle,
tagline, title”.</p>

<p>The `click` event handler is stored in this style.  See the
[[Events.click]] method for a description.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Acurve+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:curve » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”background, border, rect”.</p>

<p>The radius of curved corners on each of these rectangular elements.  As an
example, if this is set to 6, the corners of the rectangle are given a
curve with a 6-pixel radius.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Adisplace_left+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:displace_left » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Moves a shape, text block or any other kind of object to the left or right.
A positive number displaces to the right by the given number of pixels; a
negative number displaces to the left.  Displacing an object doesn’t effect
the actual layout of the page.  Before using this style, be sure to read
the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Position.displace]
<dd>
<p>docs, since its behavior can be a bit surprising.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-%3Adisplace_top+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:displace_top » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Moves a shape, text block or any other kind of object up or down.  A
positive number moves the object down by this number of pixels; a negative
number moves it up.  Displacing doesn’t effect the actual layout of the
page or the object’s true coordinates.  Read the [[Position.displace]]
docs, since its behavior can be a bit surprising.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aemphasis+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:emphasis » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Styles the text with an emphasis (commonly italicized.)</p>

<p>This style recognizes three possible settings:</p>

<pre>* &quot;normal&quot; - the font is upright.
* &quot;oblique&quot; - the font is slanted, but in a roman style.
* &quot;italic&quot; - the font is slanted in an italic style.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Afamily+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:family » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Styles the text with a given font family.  The string should contain the
family name or a comma-separated list of families.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Afill+%C2%BB+a+hex+code%2C+a+Shoes%3A%3AColor+or+a+range+of+either+%3D%3D%3D">:fill » a hex code, a <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Color.html">Shoes::Color</a> or a range of either ===</h3>

<p>For: ”arc, arrow, background, banner, caption, code, del, em, flow, image,
ins, inscription, line, link, mask, oval, para, rect, shape, span, stack,
star, strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>The color of the background pen.  For shapes, this is the fill color, the
paint inside the shape.  For text stuffs, this color is painted in the
background (as if marked with a highlighter pen.)</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Afont+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:font » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Styles the text with a font description.  The string is pretty flexible,
but can take the form “[FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]”, where
FAMILY-LIST is a comma separated list of families optionally terminated by
a comma, STYLE_OPTIONS is a whitespace separated list of words where each
WORD describes one of style, variant, weight, stretch, or gravity, and SIZE
is a decimal number (size in points) or optionally followed by the unit
modifier “px” for absolute size. Any one of the options may be absent. If
FAMILY-LIST is absent, then the default font family (Arial) will be used.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Agroup+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:group » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”radio”.</p>

<p>Indicates what group a radio button belongs to.  Without this setting,
radio buttons are grouped together with other radio buttons in their
immediate slot. “Grouping” radio buttons doesn’t mean they’ll be grouped
next to each other on the screen.  It means that only one radio button from
the group can be selected at a time.</p>

<p>By giving this style a string, the radio button will be grouped with other
radio buttons that have the same group name.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aheight+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:height » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel height of this object.  If the number is a decimal number,
the height becomes a percentage of its parent’s height (with 0.0 being 0%
and 1.0 being 100%.)</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Ahidden+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:hidden » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Hides or shows this object.  Any object with `:hidden =&gt; true` are not
displayed on the screen.  Neither are its children.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Ainner+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:inner » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”star”.</p>

<p>The size of the inner radius (in pixels.)  The inner radius describes the
solid circle within the star where the points begin to separate.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aitems+%C2%BB+an+array+%3D%3D%3D">:items » an array ===</h3>

<p>For: ”list_box”.</p>

<p>The list of selections in the list box.  See the [[Element.list_box]]
method for an example.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Ajustify+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:justify » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”</p>

<p>Evenly spaces the text horizontally.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Akerning+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:kerning » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Adds to the natural spacing between letters, in pixels.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aleading+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:leading » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, inscription, para, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Sets the spacing between lines in a text block.  Defaults to 4 pixels.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aleft+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:left » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the left coordinate of this object to a specific pixel.  Setting
`:left =&gt; 10` places the object’s left edge ten pixels away from the
left edge of the slot containing it.  If this style is left unset (or set
to `nil`,) the object will flow in with the other objects surrounding it.</p>

<p>You might also want to give it a :top, if it’s acting a bit funny.
Sometimes it needs both. :)</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Amargin+%C2%BB+a+number+or+an+array+of+four+numbers+%3D%3D%3D">:margin » a number or an array of four numbers ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Margins space an element out from its surroundings.  Each element has a
left, top, right, and bottom margin.  If the `:margin` style is set to a
single number, the spacing around the element uniformly matches that
number.  In other words, if `:margin =&gt; 8` is set, all the margins
around the element are set to eight pixels in length.</p>

<p>This style can also be given an array of four numbers in the form `[left,
top, right, bottom]`.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Amargin_bottom+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:margin_bottom » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the bottom margin of the element to a specific pixel size.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Amargin_left+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:margin_left » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the left margin of the element to a specific pixel size.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Amargin_right+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:margin_right » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the right margin of the element to a specific pixel size.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Amargin_top+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:margin_top » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the top margin of the element to a specific pixel size.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aouter+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:outer » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”star”.</p>

<p>Sets the outer radius (half of the ”total” width) of the star, in pixels.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Apoints+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:points » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”star”.</p>

<p>How many points does this star have?  A style of `:points =&gt; 5` creates
a five-pointed star.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aradius+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:radius » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”arc, arrow, background, border, gradient, oval, rect, shape”.</p>

<p>Sets the radius (half of the diameter or total width) for each of these
elements.  Setting this is equivalent to setting both `:width` and
`:height` to double this number.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aright+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:right » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel coordinate of an element’s right edge.  The edge is placed
relative to its container’s rightmost edge.  So, `:right =&gt; 0` will
align the element so that its own right edge and the right edge of its slot
touch. Whereas `:right =&gt; 20` will position the right edge of the
element off to the left of its slot’s right edge by twenty pixels.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Arise+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:rise » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Lifts or plunges the font baseline for some text.  For example, a</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Element.sup]
<dd>
<p>has a `:rise` of 10 pixels.  Conversely, the [[Element.sub]]</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>element has a `:rise` of -10 pixels.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Ascroll+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:scroll » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”flow, stack”.</p>

<p>Establishes this slot as a scrolling slot.  If `:scroll =&gt; true` is set,
the slot will show a scrollbar if any of its contents go past its height. 
The scrollbar will appear and disappear as needed.  It will also appear
inside the width of the slot, meaning the slot’s width will never change,
regardless of whether there is a scrollbar or not.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Asecret+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">:secret » true or false ===</h3>

<p>For: ”ask, edit_line”.</p>

<p>Used for password fields, this setting keeps any characters typed in from
becoming visible on the screen.  Instead, a replacement character (such as
an asterisk) is show for each letter typed.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Asize+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:size » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel size for the font used inside this text block or text
fragment.</p>

<p>Font size may also be augmented, through use of the following strings:</p>

<pre>* &quot;xx-small&quot; - 57% of present size.
* &quot;x-small&quot; - 64% of present size.
* &quot;small&quot; - 83% of present size.
* &quot;medium&quot; - no change in size.
* &quot;large&quot; - 120% of present size.
* &quot;x-large&quot; - 143% of present size.
* &quot;xx-large&quot; - 173% of present size.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Astate+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:state » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”button, check, edit_box, edit_line, list_box, radio”.</p>

<p>The `:state` style is for disabling or locking certain controls, if you
don’t want them to be edited.</p>

<p>Here are the possible style settings:</p>

<pre>* nil - the control is active and editable.
* &quot;readonly&quot; - the control is active but cannot be edited.
* &quot;disabled&quot; - the control is not active (grayed out) and cannot be edited.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Astretch+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:stretch » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Sets the font stretching used for a text object.</p>

<p>Possible settings are:</p>

<pre>* &quot;condensed&quot; - a smaller width of letters.
* &quot;normal&quot; - the standard width of letters.
* &quot;expanded&quot; - a larger width of letters.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Astrikecolor+%C2%BB+a+Shoes%3A%3AColor+%3D%3D%3D">:strikecolor » a <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Color.html">Shoes::Color</a> ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>The color used to paint any lines stricken through this text.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Astrikethrough+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:strikethrough » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Is this text stricken through?  Two options here:</p>

<pre>* &quot;none&quot; - no strikethrough
* &quot;single&quot; - a single-line strikethrough.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Astroke+%C2%BB+a+hex+code%2C+a+Shoes%3A%3AColor+or+a+range+of+either+%3D%3D%3D">:stroke » a hex code, a <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Color.html">Shoes::Color</a> or a range of either ===</h3>

<p>For: ”arc, arrow, banner, border, caption, code, del, em, flow, image, ins,
inscription, line, link, mask, oval, para, rect, shape, span, stack, star,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>The color of the foreground pen.  In the case of shapes, this is the color
the lines are drawn with.  For paragraphs and other text, the letters are
printed in this color.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Astrokewidth+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:strokewidth » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”arc, arrow, border, flow, image, line, mask, oval, rect, shape, star,
stack”.</p>

<p>The thickness of the stroke, in pixels, of the line defining each of these
shapes.  For example, the number two would set the strokewidth to 2 pixels.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Atext+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:text » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”button, edit_box, edit_line”.</p>

<p>Sets the message displayed on a button control, or the contents of an
edit_box or edit_line.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Atop+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:top » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the top coordinate for an object, relative to its parent slot.  If an
object is set with `:top =&gt; 40`, this means the object’s top edge will
be placed 40 pixels beneath the top edge of the slot that contains it.  If
no `:top` style is given, the object is automatically placed in the natural
flow of its slot.</p>

<p>You should probably give it a :left, too, if it’s acting strange. It likes
to have both. :)</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aundercolor+%C2%BB+a+Shoes%3A%3AColor+%3D%3D%3D">:undercolor » a <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Color.html">Shoes::Color</a> ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>The color used to underline text.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Aunderline+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:underline » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Dictates the style of underline used in the text.</p>

<p>The choices for this setting are:</p>

<pre>* &quot;none&quot; - no underline at all.
* &quot;single&quot; - a continuous underline.
* &quot;double&quot; - two continuous parallel underlines.
* &quot;low&quot; - a lower underline, beneath the font baseline.  (This is generally recommended only for single characters, particularly when showing keyboard accelerators.)
* &quot;error&quot; - a wavy underline, usually found indicating a misspelling.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Avariant+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:variant » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Vary the font for a group of text.  Two choices:</p>

<pre>* &quot;normal&quot; - standard font.
* &quot;smallcaps&quot; - font with the lower case characters replaced by smaller variants of the capital characters.</pre>

<h3 id="label-%3Aweight+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:weight » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”.</p>

<p>Set the boldness of the text.  Commonly, this style is set to one of the
following strings:</p>

<pre>* &quot;ultralight&quot; - the ultralight weight (= 200)
* &quot;light&quot; - the light weight (= 300)
* &quot;normal&quot; - the default weight (= 400)
* &quot;semibold&quot; - a weight intermediate between normal and bold (= 600)
* &quot;bold&quot; - the bold weight (= 700)
* &quot;ultrabold&quot; - the ultrabold weight (= 800)
* &quot;heavy&quot; - the heavy weight (= 900)</pre>

<p>However, you may also pass in the numerical weight directly.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Awidth+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">:width » a number ===</h3>

<p>For: ”all slots and elements”.</p>

<p>Sets the pixel width for the element.  If the number is a decimal, the
width is converted to a percentage (with 0.0 being 0% and 1.0 being 100%.) 
A width of 100% means the object fills its parent slot.</p>

<h3 id="label-%3Awrap+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">:wrap » a string ===</h3>

<p>For: ”banner, caption, code, del, em, ins, inscription, link, para, span,
strong, sub, sup, subtitle, tagline, title”</p>

<p>How should the text wrap when it fills its width? Possible options are:</p>

<pre>* &quot;word&quot; - Break lines at word breaks.
* &quot;char&quot; - Break lines between characters, thus breaking some words.
* &quot;trim&quot; - Cut the line off with an ellipsis if it goes too long.</pre>

<h2 id="label-Classes+List+%3D%3D">Classes List ==</h2>

<p>Here is a complete list of all the classes introduced by <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  This chart is laid out
according to how classes inherits from each other.  Subclasses are indented
one level to the right, beneath their parent class.</p>

<p>{INDEX}</p>

<h2 id="label-Colors+List+%3D%3D">Colors List ==</h2>

<p>The following list of colors can be used throughout <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  As background colors or border
colors.  As stroke and fill colors.  Most of these colors come from the X11
and HTML palettes.</p>

<p>All of these colors can be used by name.  (So calling the `tomato` method
from inside any slot will get you a nice reddish color.)  Below each color,
also find the exact numbers which can be used with the [[Built-in.rgb]]
method.</p>

<p>{COLORS}</p>

<h1 id="label-Slots+%3D">Slots =</h1>

<p>Slots are boxes used to lay out images, text and so on. The two most common
slots are `stacks` and `flows`. Slots can also be referred to as “boxes” or
“canvases” in <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> terminology.</p>

<p>Since the mouse wheel and PageUp and PageDown are so pervasive on every
platform, vertical scrolling has really become the only overflow that
matters. So, in <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, just as on
the web, width is generally fixed. While height goes on and on.</p>

<p>Now, you can also just use specific widths and heights for everything, if
you want. That’ll take some math, but everything could be perfect.</p>

<p>Generally, I’d suggest using stacks and flows. The idea here is that you
want to fill up a certain width with things, then advance down the page,
filling up further widths. You can think of these as being analogous to
HTML’s “block” and “inline” styles.</p>

<h4 id="label-Stacks+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Stacks ====</h4>

<p>A stack is simply a vertical stack of elements. Each element in a stack is
placed directly under the element preceding it.</p>

<p>A stack is also shaped like a box. So if a stack is given a width of 250,
that stack is itself an element which is 250 pixels wide.</p>

<p>To create a new stack, use the [[Element.stack]] method, which is available
inside any slot.  So stacks can contain other stacks and flows.</p>

<h4 id="label-Flows+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Flows ====</h4>

<p>A flow will pack elements in as tightly as it can. A width will be filled,
then will wrap beneath those elements. Text elements placed next to each
other will appear as a single paragraph. Images and widgets will run
together as a series.</p>

<p>Like the stack, a flow is a box. So stacks and flows can safely be embedded
and, without respect to their contents, are identical. They just treat
their contents differently.</p>

<p>Making a flow means calling the [[Element.flow]] method.  Flows may contain
other flows and stacks.</p>

<p>Last thing: The <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> window itself
is a flow.</p>

<h2 id="label-Art+for+Slots+%3D%3D">Art for Slots ==</h2>

<p>Each slot is like a canvas, a blank surface which can be covered with an
assortment of colored shapes or gradients.</p>

<p>Many common shapes can be drawn with methods like `oval` and `rect`. 
You’ll need to set up the paintbrush colors first, though.</p>

<p>The `stroke` command sets the line color.  And the `fill` command sets the
color used to paint inside the lines.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>That code gives you a blue pie with a red line around it.  One-hundred
pixels wide, placed just a few pixels southeast of the window’s upper left
corner.</p>

<p>The `blue` and `red` methods above are Color objects.  See the section on
Colors for more on how to mix colors.</p>

<h4 id="label-Inspiration+from+Processing+and+NodeBox+%3D%3D%3D%3D">Inspiration from Processing and NodeBox ====</h4>

<p>The artful methods generally come verbatim from NodeBox, a drawing kit for
Python.  In turn, NodeBox gets much of its ideas from Processing, a
Java-like language for graphics and animation.  I owe a great debt to the
creators of these wonderful programs!</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> does a few things differently
from NodeBox and Processing.  For example, <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has different color methods,
including having its own Color objects, though these are very similar to
Processing’s color methods.  And <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also allows images and gradients
to be used for drawing lines and filling in shapes.</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also borrows some animation
ideas from Processing and will continue to closely consult Processing’s
methods as it expands.</p>

<h3 id="label-arc%28left%2C+top%2C+width%2C+height%2C+angle1%2C+angle2%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">arc(left, top, width, height, angle1, angle2) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draws an arc shape (a section of an oval) at coordinates (left, top).  This
method just give you a bit more control than [[oval]], by offering the
`:angle1` and `:angle2` styles.  (In fact, you can mimick the `oval` method
by setting `:angle1` to 0 and `:angle2` to `Shoes::TWO_PI`.)</p>

<h3 id="label-arrow%28left%2C+top%2C+width%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">arrow(left, top, width) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draws an arrow at coordinates (left, top) with a pixel `width`.</p>

<h3 id="label-cap%28%3Acurve+or+%3Arect+or+%3Aproject%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">cap(:curve or :rect or :project) » self ===</h3>

<p>Sets the line cap, which is the shape at the end of every line you draw. 
If set to `:curve`, the end is rounded.  The default is `:rect`, a line
which ends abruptly flat.  The `:project` cap is also fat, but sticks out a
bit longer.</p>

<h3 id="label-fill%28pattern%29+%C2%BB+pattern+%3D%3D%3D">fill(pattern) » pattern ===</h3>

<p>Sets the fill bucket to a specific color (or pattern.)  Patterns can be
colors, gradients or images.  So, once the fill bucket is set, you can draw
shapes and they will be colored in with the pattern you’ve chosen.</p>

<p>To draw a star with an image pattern:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  fill &quot;static/avatar.png&quot;
  star 200, 200, 5
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>To clear the fill bucket, use `nofill`.  And to set the line color (the
border of the star,) use the `stroke` method.</p>

<h3 id="label-nofill%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">nofill() » self ===</h3>

<p>Blanks the fill color, so that any shapes drawn will not be filled in.
Instead, shapes will have only a lining, leaving the middle transparent.</p>

<h3 id="label-nostroke%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">nostroke() » self ===</h3>

<p>Empties the line color.  Shapes drawn will have no outer line.  If `nofill`
is also set, shapes drawn will not be visible.</p>

<h3 id="label-line%28left%2C+top%2C+x2%2C+y2%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">line(left, top, x2, y2) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draws a line using the current line color (aka “stroke”) starting at
coordinates (left, top) and ending at coordinates (x2, y2).</p>

<h3 id="label-oval%28left%2C+top%2C+radius%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">oval(left, top, radius) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draws a circular form at pixel coordinates (left, top) with a width and
height of `radius` pixels.  The line and fill colors are used to draw the
shape.  By default, the coordinates are for the oval’s leftmost, top
corner, but this can be changed by calling the [[Art.transform]] method or
by using the `:center` style on the next method below.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stroke blue
  strokewidth 4
  fill black
  oval 10, 10, 50
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>To draw an oval of varied proportions, you may also use the syntax:
`oval(left, top, width, height)`.</p>

<h3 id="label-oval%28styles%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">oval(styles) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draw circular form using a style hash.  The following styles are supported:</p>

<pre>* `top`: the y-coordinate for the oval pen.
* `left`: the x-coordinate for the oval pen.
* `radius`: the width and height of the circle.
* `width`: a specific pixel width for the oval.
* `height`: a specific pixel height for the oval.
* `center`: do the coordinates specific the oval's center? (true or false)</pre>

<p>These styles may also be altered using the `style` method on the Shape
object.</p>

<h3 id="label-rect%28top%2C+left%2C+width%2C+height%2C+corners+%3D+0%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">rect(top, left, width, height, corners = 0) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draws a rectangle starting from coordinates (top, left) with dimensions of
width x height.  Optionally, you may give the rectangle rounded corners
with a fifth argument: the radius of the corners in pixels.</p>

<p>As with all other shapes, the rectangle is drawn using the stroke and fill
colors.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stroke rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.7)
  fill rgb(1.0, 1.0, 0.9)
  rect 10, 10, self.width - 20, self.height - 20
end</pre>

<p>The above sample draws a rectangle which fills the area of its parent box,
leaving a margin of 10 pixels around the edge.  Also see the `background`
method for a rectangle which defaults to filling its parent box.</p>

<h3 id="label-rect%28styles%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">rect(styles) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draw a rectangle using a style hash.  The following styles are supported:</p>

<pre>* `top`: the y-coordinate for the rectangle.
* `left`: the x-coordinate for the rectangle.
* `curve`: the pixel radius of the rectangle's corners.
* `width`: a specific pixel width for the rectangle.
* `height`: a specific pixel height for the rectangle.
* `center`: do the coordinates specific the rectangle's center? (true or false)</pre>

<p>These styles may also be altered using the `style` method on the Shape
object.</p>

<h3 id="label-rotate%28degrees%3A+a+number%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">rotate(degrees: a number) » self ===</h3>

<p>Rotates the pen used for drawing by a certain number of `degrees`, so that
any shapes will be drawn at that angle.</p>

<p>In this example below, the rectangle drawn at (30, 30) will be rotated 45
degrees.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  fill &quot;#333&quot;
  rotate 45
  rect 30, 30, 40, 40
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<h3 id="label-shape%28left%2C+top%29+%7B+...+%7D+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">shape(left, top) { … } » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Describes an arbitrary shape to draw, beginning at coordinates (left, top)
and continued by calls to `line_to`, `move_to`, `curve_to` and `arc_to`
inside the block.  You can look at it as sketching a shape with a long line
that curves and arcs and bends.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  fill red(0.2)
  shape do
    move_to(90, 55)
    arc_to(50, 55, 50, 50, 0, PI/2)
    arc_to(50, 55, 60, 60, PI/2, PI)
    arc_to(50, 55, 70, 70, PI, TWO_PI-PI/2)
    arc_to(50, 55, 80, 80, TWO_PI-PI/2, TWO_PI)
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>A shape can also contain other shapes.  So, you can place an [[Art.oval]],
a</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Art.rect]], a [[Art.line]], a [[Art.star]
<dd>
<p>or an [[Art.arrow]] (and all of</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>the other methods in this [[Art]] section) inside a shape, but they will
not be part of the line.  They will be more like a group of shapes are all
drawn as one.</p>

<h3 id="label-star%28left%2C+top%2C+points+%3D+10%2C+outer+%3D+100.0%2C+inner+%3D+50.0%29+%C2%BB+Shoes%3A%3AShape+%3D%3D%3D">star(left, top, points = 10, outer = 100.0, inner = 50.0) » <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Shape.html">Shoes::Shape</a> ===</h3>

<p>Draws a star using the stroke and fill colors.  The star is positioned with
its center point at coordinates (left, top) with a certain number of
`points`.  The `outer` width defines the full radius of the star; the
`inner` width specifies the radius of the star’s middle, where points stem
from.</p>

<h3 id="label-stroke%28pattern%29+%C2%BB+pattern+%3D%3D%3D">stroke(pattern) » pattern ===</h3>

<p>Set the active line color for this slot.  The `pattern` may be a color, a
gradient or an image, all of which are categorized as “patterns.”  The line
color is then used to draw the borders of any subsequent shape.</p>

<p>So, to draw an arrow with a red line around it:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stroke red
  arrow 0, 100, 10
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>To clear the line color, use the `nostroke` method.</p>

<h3 id="label-strokewidth%28a+number%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">strokewidth(a number) » self ===</h3>

<p>Sets the line size for all drawing within this slot.  Whereas the `stroke`
method alters the line color, the `strokewidth` method alters the line size
in pixels.  Calling `strokewidth(4)` will cause lines to be drawn 4 pixels
wide.</p>

<h3 id="label-transform%28%3Acenter+or+%3Acorner%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">transform(:center or :corner) » self ===</h3>

<p>Should transformations (such as `skew` and `rotate`) be performed around
the center of the shape?  Or the corner of the shape?  <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> defaults to `:corner`.</p>

<h3 id="label-translate%28left%2C+top%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">translate(left, top) » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves the starting point of the drawing pen for this slot.  Normally, the
pen starts at (0, 0) in the top-left corner, so that all shapes are drawn
from that point.  With `translate`, if the starting point is moved to (10,
20) and a shape is drawn at (50, 60), then the shape is actually drawn at
(60, 80) on the slot.</p>

<h2 id="label-Element+Creation+%3D%3D">Element Creation ==</h2>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has a wide variety of

<p>Starts an animation timer, which runs parallel to the rest of the app.  The
`fps` is a number, the frames per seconds.  This number dictates how many
times per second the attached block will be called.</p>

<p>The block is given a `frame` number.  Starting with zero, the `frame`
number tells the block how many frames of the animation have been shown.</p>

<p>Draws a Background element with a specific color (or pattern.)  Patterns
can be colors, gradients or images.  Colors and images will tile across the
background.  Gradients stretch to fill the background.</p>

<p>”‘PLEASE NOTE:”’ Backgrounds are actual elements, not styles.  HTML treats

formats are allowed.</p>

<p>The `path` can be a file path or a URL.  All images loaded are temporarily
cached in memory, but remote images are also cached locally in the user’s
personal <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> directory.  Remote
images are loaded in the background; as with browsers, the images will not

<p>difference is that the `window` method sets the new window’s [[App.owner]]
property.  (A normal Shoes.app has its `owner` set to `nil`.)</p>

<p>So, the new window’s `owner` will be set to the <a

<p>Mouse events include `motion`, `click`, `hover` and `leave`.  Keyboard
typing is represented by the `keypress` event.  And the `start` and
`finish` events indicate when a canvas comes into play or is discarded.</p>

<p>So, let’s say you want to change the background of a slot whenever the
mouse floats over it.  We can use the `hover` event to change the
background when the mouse comes inside the slot.  And `leave` to change
back when the mouse floats away.</p>

<p>The click block is called when a mouse button is clicked.  The `button` is
the number of the mouse button which has been pressed.  The `left` and
`top` are the mouse coordinates at which the click happened.</p>

<p>To catch the moment when the mouse is unclicked, see the [[Events.release]]
event.</p>

<h3 id="label-finish+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">finish { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When a slot is removed, it’s finish event occurs.  The finish block is
immediately handed `self`, the slot object which has been removed.</p>

<h3 id="label-hover+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">hover { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>The hover event happens when the mouse enters the slot.  The block gets
`self`, meaning the object which was hovered over.</p>

<p>To catch the mouse exiting the slot, check out the [[Events.leave]] event.</p>

<h3 id="label-keypress+%7B+%7Ckey%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">keypress { |key| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Whenever a key (or combination of keys) is pressed, the block gets called. 
The block is sent a `key` which is a string representing the character
(such as the letter or number) on the key.  For special keys and key
combos, a Ruby symbol is sent, rather than a string.</p>

<p>So, for example, if `Shift-a` is pressed, the block will get the string
`“A”`.</p>

<p>However, if the F1 key is pressed, the `:f1` symbol is received.  For
`Shift-F1`, the symbol would be `:shift_f1`.</p>

<p>The modifier keys are `control`, `shift` and `alt`.  They appear in that
order. If `Shift-Control-Alt-PgUp` is pressed, the symbol will be
`:control_shift_alt_page_up`.</p>

<p>One thing about the shift key.  You won’t see the shift key on most keys. 
On US keyboards, `Shift-7` is an ampersand.  So you’ll get the string
`“&amp;”` rather than `:shift_5`.  And, if you press `Shift-Alt-7` on such
a keyboard, you’ll get the symbol: `:alt_&amp;`.  You’ll only see the shift
modifier on the special keys listed a few paragraphs down.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> itself uses
a few hotkeys.  Alt-Period (`:alt_.`), Alt-Question (`:alt_?`) and
Alt-Slash (`:alt_/`) are reserved for <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.</p>

<p>The list of special keys is as follows: `:escape`, `:delete`, `:backspace`,
`:tab`, `:page_up`, `:page_down`, `:home`, `:end`, `:left`, `:up`,
`:right`, `:down`, `:f1`, `:f2`, `:f3`, `:f4`, `:f5`, `:f6`, `:f7`, `:f8`,
`:f9`, `:f10`, `:f11` and `:f12`.</p>

<p>One caveat to all of those rules: normally the Return key gives you a
string `“n”`.  When pressed with modifier keys, however, you end up with
`:control_enter`, `:control_alt_enter`, `:shift_alt_enter` and the like.</p>

<h3 id="label-leave+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">leave { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>The leave event takes place when the mouse cursor exits a slot.  The moment
it no longer is inside the slot’s edges.  When that takes place, the block
is called with `self`, the slot object which is being left.</p>

<p>Also see [[Events.hover]] if you’d like to detect the mouse entering a
slot.</p>

<h3 id="label-motion+%7B+%7Cleft%2C+top%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">motion { |left, top| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>The motion block gets called every time the mouse moves around inside the
slot. The block is handed the cursor’s `left` and `top` coordinates.</p>

<h3 id="label-before%28element%29+%7B+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">before(element) { … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Adds elements to a specific place in a slot, just before the `element`
which is a child of the slot.</p>

<h3 id="label-clear%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">clear() » self ===</h3>

<p>Empties the slot of any elements, timers and nested slots.  This is
effectively identical to looping through the contents of the slot and
calling each element’s `remove` method.</p>

<h3 id="label-clear%28%29+%7B+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">clear() { … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Each style setting also has a method, which can be used to grab that
particular setting.  (So, like, the `width` method returns the width of the
slot in pixels.)</p>

<h3 id="label-displace%28left%3A+a+number%2C+top%3A+a+number%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">displace(left: a number, top: a number) » self ===</h3>

<p>A shortcut method for setting the :displace_left and :displace_top styles.
Displacing is a handy way of moving a slot without altering the layout.  In
fact, the `top` and `left` methods will not report displacement at all. 
So, generally, displacement is only for temporary animations.  For example,
jiggling a button in place.</p>

<p>The `left` and `top` numbers sent to `displace` are added to the slot’s own
top-left coordinates.  To subtract from the top-left coordinate, use
negative numbers.</p>

<h3 id="label-gutter%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">gutter() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The size of the scrollbar area.  When <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> needs to show a scrollbar, the
scrollbar may end up covering up some elements that touch the edge of the
window.  The `gutter` tells you how many pixels to expect the scrollbar to
cover.</p>

<p>This is commonly used to pad elements on the right, like so:</p>

<h3 id="label-height%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">height() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The vertical size of the viewable slot in pixels.  So, if this is a
scrolling slot, you’ll need to use `scroll_height()` to get the full size
of the slot.</p>

<h3 id="label-hide%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">hide() » self ===</h3>

<p>Hides the slot, so that it can’t be seen.  See also [[Position.show]] and
[[Position.toggle]].</p>

<h3 id="label-left%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">left() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The left pixel location of the slot.  Also known as the x-axis coordinate.</p>

<h3 id="label-move%28left%2C+top%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">move(left, top) » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves the slot to specific coordinates, the (left, top) being the upper
left hand corner of the slot.</p>

<h3 id="label-remove%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">remove() » self ===</h3>

<p>Removes the slot. It will no longer be displayed and will not be listed in
its parent’s contents. It’s gone.</p>

<h3 id="label-scroll%28%29+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">scroll() » true or false ===</h3>

<p>Is this slot allowed to show a scrollbar? True or false. The scrollbar will
only appear if the height of the slot is also fixed.</p>

<h3 id="label-scroll_height%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">scroll_height() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The vertical size of the full slot, including any of it which is hidden by
scrolling.</p>

<h3 id="label-scroll_max%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">scroll_max() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The top coordinate which this slot can be scrolled down to.  The top
coordinate of a scroll bar is always zero.  The bottom coordinate is the
full height of the slot minus one page of scrolling.  This bottom
coordinate is what `scroll_max` returns.</p>

<p>This is basically a shortcut for writing `slot.scroll_height -
slot.height`.</p>

<p>To scroll to the bottom of a slot, use `slot.scroll_top = slot.scroll_max`.</p>

<h3 id="label-scroll_top%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">scroll_top() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The top coordinate which this slot is scrolled down to.  So, if the slot is
scrolled down twenty pixels, this method will return `20`.</p>

<h3 id="label-scroll_top+%3D+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">scroll_top = a number ===</h3>

<p>Scrolls the slot to a certain coordinate.  This must be between zero and
`scroll_max`.</p>

<h3 id="label-show%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">show() » self ===</h3>

<p>Reveals the slot, if it is hidden.  See also [[Position.hide]] and
[[Position.toggle]].</p>

<h3 id="label-style%28%29+%C2%BB+styles+%3D%3D%3D">style() » styles ===</h3>

<p>Calling the `style` method with no arguments returns a hash of the styles
presently applied to this slot.</p>

<p>While methods such as `height` and `width` return the true pixel dimensions
of the slot, you can use `<a href="http://:height">style</a>` or `<a
href="http://:width">style</a>` to get the dimensions originally requested.</p>

<p>You may find yourself needing to loop through the elements inside a slot.
Or maybe you need to climb the page, looking for a stack that is the parent
of an element.</p>

<p>On any element, you may call the `parent` method to get the slot directly
above it. And on slots, you can call the `contents` method to get all of
the children. (Some elements, such as text blocks, also have a `contents`
method for getting their children.)</p>

<h3 id="label-contents%28%29+%C2%BB+an+array+of+elements+%3D%3D%3D">contents() » an array of elements ===</h3>

<p>Gets the object for this element’s container.</p>

<h1 id="label-Elements+%3D">Elements =</h1>

<p>Ah, here’s the stuff of <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>. An
element can be as simple as an oval shape. Or as complex as a video stream.
You’ve encountered all of these elements before in the Slots section of the
manual.</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> has seven native controls: the
Button, the EditLine, the EditBox, the ListBox, the Progress meter, the
Check box and the Radio.  By “native” controls, we mean that each of these
seven elements is drawn by the operating system.  So, a Progress bar will
look one way on Windows and another way on OS X.</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also has seven basic other
types of elements: Background, Border, Image, Shape, TextBlock, Timer and
Video.  These all should look and act the same on every operating system.</p>

<p>Once an element is created, you will often still want to change it. To move
it or hide it or get rid of it. You’ll use the commands in this section to
do that sort of stuff. (Especially check out the [[Common Common Methods]]
section for commands you can use on any element.)</p>

<p>So, for example, use the `image` method of a Slot to place a PNG on the
screen. The `image` method gives you back an Image object. Use the methods
of the Image object to change things up.</p>

<h2 id="label-Common+Methods+%3D%3D">Common Methods ==</h2>

<p>A few methods are shared by every little element in <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>.  Moving, showing, hiding. 
Removing an element.  Basic and very general things.  This list encompasses
those common commands.</p>

<p>One of the most general methods of all is the `style` method (which is also
covered as the [[Position.style]] method for slots.)</p>

<h3 id="label-displace%28left%3A+a+number%2C+top%3A+a+number%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">displace(left: a number, top: a number) » self ===</h3>

<p>Displacing an element moves it.  But without changing the layout around it.
This is great for subtle animations, especially if you want to reserve a
place for an element while it is still animating.  Like maybe a quick
button shake or a slot sliding into view.</p>

<p>When you displace an element, it moves relative to the upper-left corner
where it was placed.  So, if an element is at the coordinates (20, 40) and
you displace it 2 pixels left and 6 pixels on top, you end up with the
coordinates (22, 46).</p>

<p>Notice that while the second button bounces, the other two buttons stay
put. If we used a normal `move` in this situation, the second button would
be moved out of the layout and the buttons would act as if the second
button wasn’t there at all.  (See the [[Common.move]] example.)</p>

<p>”‘Of particular note:”’ if you use the `left` and `top` methods to get the
coordinates of a displaced element, you’ll just get back the normal
coordinates.  As if there was no displacement.  Displacing is just intended
for quick animations!</p>

<h3 id="label-height%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">height() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The vertical screen size of the element in pixels. In the case of images,
this is not the full size of the image. This is the height of the element
as it is shown right now.</p>

<p>If you have a 150x150 pixel image and you set the width to 50 pixels, this
method will return 50.</p>

comments.</p>

<p>Moves the element to a specific pixel position within its slot.  The
element is still inside the slot.  But it will no longer be stacked or
flowed in with the other stuff in the slot.  The element will float freely,
now absolutely positioned instead.</p>

<p>In order to set the width, you’ll have to go through the [[Common.style]]
method again.  So, to set the button to 150 pixels wide: `@b.style(:width
=&gt; 150)`.</p>

<p>To let <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> pick the element’s
width, go with `@b.style(:width =&gt; nil)` to empty out the setting.</p>

<h2 id="label-Background+%3D%3D">Background ==</h2>

<p>A background is a color, a gradient or an image that is painted across an
entire slot.  Both backgrounds and borders are a type of <a
href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a>. !{:margin_left
=&gt; 100}man-ele-background.png!</p>

<p>Even though it’s called a ”background”, you may still place this element in
front of other elements.  If a background comes after something else
painted on the slot (like a `rect` or an `oval`,) the background will be
painted over that element.</p>

<p>The simplest background is just a plain color background, created with the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Element.background]
<dd>
<p>method, such as this black background:</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  background black
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>A simple background like that paints the entire slot that contains it.  (In
this case, the whole window is painted black.)</p>

<p>You can use styles to cut down the size or move around the background to
your liking.</p>

<p>To paint a black background across the top fifty pixels of the window:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment">#!ruby</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

<p>Or, to paint a fifty pixel column on the right-side of the window:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>Since Backgrounds are normal elements as well, see also the start of the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Elements]
<dd>
<p>section for all of its other methods.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3 id="label-to_pattern%28%29+%C2%BB+a+Shoes%3A%3APattern+%3D%3D%3D">to_pattern() » a <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a> ===</h3>

<p>Yanks out the color, gradient or image used to paint this background and
places it in a normal <a
href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a> object.  You can
then pass that object to other backgrounds and borders.  Reuse it as you
like.</p>

<h2 id="label-Border+%3D%3D">Border ==</h2>

<p>A border is a color, gradient or image painted in a line around the edge of
any slot.  Like the Background element in the last section, a Border is a
kind of <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a>.
!{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-border.png!</p>

<p>The first, crucial thing to know about border is that all borders paint a
line around the ”‘inside”’ of a slot, not the outside.  So, if you have a
slot which is fifty pixels wide and you paint a five pixel border on it,
that means there is a fourty pixel wide area inside the slot which is
surrounded by the border.</p>

<p>This also means that if you paint a Border on top of a [[Background]], the
edges of the background will be painted over by the border.</p>

<p>Here is just such a slot:</p>

<p>In HTML and many other languages, the border is painted on the outside of
the box, thus increasing the overall width of the box.  <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> was designed with consistency in
mind, so that if you say that a box is fifty pixels wide, it stays fifty
pixels wide regardless of its borders or margins or anything else.</p>

<p>Please also check out the [[Elements]] section for other methods used on
borders.</p>

<h3 id="label-to_pattern%28%29+%C2%BB+a+Shoes%3A%3APattern+%3D%3D%3D">to_pattern() » a <a href="../../classes/Shoes/Pattern.html">Shoes::Pattern</a> ===</h3>

<p>Creates a basic pattern object based on the color, gradient or image used
to paint this border.  The pattern may then be re-used in new borders and
backgrounds.</p>

<h2 id="label-Button+%3D%3D">Button ==</h2>

<p>Buttons are, you know, push buttons.  You click them and they do something.
Buttons are known to say “OK” or “Are you sure?”  And, then, if you’re
sure, you click the button. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-button.png!</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  button &quot;OK!&quot;
  button &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>The buttons in the example above don’t do anything when you click them. In
order to get them to work, you’ve got to hook up a block to each button.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  button &quot;OK!&quot; do
    append { para &quot;Well okay then.&quot; }
  end
  button &quot;Are you sure?&quot; do
    append { para &quot;Your confidence is inspiring.&quot; }
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So now we’ve got blocks for the buttons. Each block appends a new paragraph
to the page. The more you click, the more paragraphs get added.</p>

<p>It doesn’t go much deeper than that. A button is just a clickable phrase.</p>

<p>Just to be pedantic, though, here’s another way to write that last example.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  @b1 = button &quot;OK!&quot;
  @b1.click { para &quot;Well okay then.&quot; }
  @b2 = button &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
  @b2.click { para &quot;Your confidence is inspiring.&quot; }
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This looks dramatically different, but it does the same thing.  The first
difference: rather than attaching the block directly to the button, the
block is attached later, through the `click` method.</p>

<p>The second change isn’t related to buttons at all.  The `append` block was
dropped since <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> allows you to
add new elements directly to the slot.  So we can just call `para`
directly.  (This isn’t the case with the `prepend`, `before` or `after`
methods.)</p>

<p>Beside the methods below, buttons also inherit all of the methods that are
[[Common]].</p>

<h3 id="label-click%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">click() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When a button is clicked, its `click` block is called.  The block is handed
`self`.  Meaning: the button which was clicked.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the button.  The button will be highlighted and, if the user
hits Enter, the button will be clicked.</p>

<h2 id="label-Check+%3D%3D">Check ==</h2>

<p>Check boxes are clickable square boxes than can be either checked or
unchecked. A single checkbox usually asks a “yes” or “no” question.  Sets
of checkboxes are also seen in to-do lists. !{:margin_left =&gt;
100}man-ele-check.png!</p>

<p>Here’s a sample checklist.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    flow { check; para &quot;Frances Johnson&quot; }
    flow { check; para &quot;Ignatius J. Reilly&quot; }
    flow { check; para &quot;Winston Niles Rumfoord&quot; }
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>You basically have two ways to use a check.  You can attach a block to the
check and it’ll get called when the check gets clicked.  And/or you can
just use the `checked?` method to go back and see if a box has been checked
or not.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s add to the above example.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment">#!ruby</span>

    <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

    <span class="ruby-identifier">button</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;What's been checked?&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So, when the button gets pressed, each of the checks gets asked for its
status, using the `checked?` method.</p>

<p>Button methods are listed below, but also see the list of [[Common]]
methods, which all elements respond to.</p>

<h3 id="label-checked%3F%28%29+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked?() » true or false ===</h3>

<p>Returns whether the box is checked or not.  So, `true` means “yes, the box
is checked!”</p>

<h3 id="label-checked+%3D+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked = true or false ===</h3>

<p>Marks or unmarks the check box.  Using `checked = false`, for instance,
unchecks the box.</p>

<h3 id="label-click%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">click() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When the check is clicked, its `click` block is called.  The block is
handed `self`, which is the check object which was clicked.</p>

<h2 id="label-EditBox+%3D%3D">EditBox ==</h2>

<p>Edit boxes are wide, rectangular boxes for entering text.  On the web, they
call these textareas.  These are multi-line edit boxes for entering longer
descriptions.  Essays, even! !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-editbox.png!</p>

<p>Without any other styling, edit boxes are sized 200 pixels by 108 pixels. 
You can also use `:width` and `:height` styles to set specific sizes.</p>

methods, which all elements respond to.</p>

<h3 id="label-change%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">change() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Each time a character is added to or removed from the edit box, its

object which has changed.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the edit box. The edit box will be highlighted and the user

<h2 id="label-EditLine+%3D%3D">EditLine ==</h2>

<p>Edit lines are a slender, little box for entering text. While the EditBox
is multi-line, an edit line is just one. Line, that is. Horizontal, in
fact. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-editline.png!</p>

<p>The unstyled edit line is 200 pixels wide and 28 pixels wide. Roughly. The
height may vary on some platforms.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<p>You can change the size by styling both the `:width` and the `:height`.
However, you generally only want to style the `:width`, as the height will
be sized to fit the font. (And, in current versions of <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, the font for edit lines and edit
boxes cannot be altered anyway.)</p>

<p>If a block is given to an edit line, it receives `change` events. Check out

<h3 id="label-change%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">change() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Each time a character is added to or removed from the edit line, its

object which has changed.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<h2 id="label-Image+%3D%3D">Image ==</h2>

<p>An image is a picture in PNG, JPEG or GIF format. <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> can resize images or flow them in
with text. Images can be loaded from a file or directly off the web.
!{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-image.png!</p>

<p>To create an image, use the `image` method in a slot:</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  para &quot;Nice, nice, very nice.  Busy, busy, busy.&quot;
  image &quot;static/shoes-manual-apps.gif&quot;
 end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>When you load any image into <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>,
it is cached in memory. This means that if you load up many image elements
from the same file, it’ll only really load the file once.</p>

<p>You can use web URLs directly as well.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  image &quot;http://hacketyhack.heroku.com/images/logo.png&quot;
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>When an image is loaded from the web, it’s cached on the hard drive as well
as in memory. This prevents a repeat download unless the image has changed.
(In case you’re wondering: <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>
keeps track of modification times and etags just like a browser would.)</p>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> also loads remote images in
the background using system threads. So, using remote images will not block
Ruby or any intense graphical displays you may have going on.</p>

<h3 id="label-full_height%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">full_height() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The full pixel height of the image. Normally, you can just use the</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>[Common.height]
<dd>
<p>method to figure out how many pixels high the image is. But</p>
</dd></dl>

<p>if you’ve resized the image or styled it to be larger or something, then
`height` will return the scaled size.</p>

<p>The `full_height` method gives you the height of image (in pixels) as it
was stored in the original file.</p>

<h3 id="label-full_width%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">full_width() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The full pixel width of the image. See the [[Image.full_height]] method for
an explanation of why you might use this method rather than
[[Common.width]].</p>

<h3 id="label-path%28%29+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">path() » a string ===</h3>

<p>The URL or file name of the image.</p>

<h3 id="label-path+%3D+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">path = a string ===</h3>

<p>Swaps the image with a different one, loaded from a file or URL.</p>

<h2 id="label-ListBox+%3D%3D">ListBox ==</h2>

<p>List boxes (also called “combo boxes” or “drop-down boxes” or “select
boxes” in some places) are a list of options that drop down when you click
on the box. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-listbox.png!</p>

<p>A list box gets its options from an array.  An array (a list) of strings,
passed into the `:items` style.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment">#!ruby</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>So, the basic size of a list box is about 200 pixels wide and 28 pixels
high. You can adjust this length using the `:width` style.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment">#!ruby</span>
<span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

    :<span class="ruby-identifier">width</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-value">120</span>, :<span class="ruby-identifier">choose</span> =<span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Apricots&quot;</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span> <span class="ruby-operator">|</span><span class="ruby-identifier">list</span><span class="ruby-operator">|</span>

<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>
</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Next to the `:width` style, the example uses another useful option. The
`:choose` option tells the list box which of the items should be
highlighted from the beginning. (There’s also a [[ListBox.choose]] method
for highlighting an item after the box is created.)</p>

<p>List boxes also have a [[ListBox.change]] event. In the last example, we’ve
got a block hooked up to the list box. Well, okay, see, that’s a `change`
block. The block is called each time someone changes the selected item.</p>

<p>Those are the basics. Might you also be persuaded to look at the [[Common]]
methods page, a complete list of the methods that all elements have?</p>

<h3 id="label-change%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">change() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>Whenever someone highlights a new option in the list box (by clicking on an
item, for instance,) its `change` block is called. The block is given
`self`, which is the list box object which has changed.</p>

<h3 id="label-choose%28item%3A+a+string%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">choose(item: a string) » self ===</h3>

<p>Selects the option in the list box that matches the string given by `item`.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the list box. The list box will be highlighted and, if the
user hits the up and down arrow keys, other options in the list will be
selected.</p>

<h3 id="label-items%28%29+%C2%BB+an+array+of+strings+%3D%3D%3D">items() » an array of strings ===</h3>

<p>Returns the complete list of strings that the list box presently shows as
its options.</p>

<h3 id="label-items+%3D+an+array+of+strings+%3D%3D%3D">items = an array of strings ===</h3>

<p>Replaces the list box’s options with a new list of strings.</p>

<h3 id="label-text%28%29+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">text() » a string ===</h3>

<p>A string containing whatever text is shown highlighted in the list box
right now. If nothing is selected, `nil` will be the reply.</p>

<h2 id="label-Progress+%3D%3D">Progress ==</h2>

<p>Progress bars show you how far along you are in an activity. Usually, a
progress bar represents a percentage (from 0% to 100%.) <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> thinks of progress in terms of
the decimal numbers 0.0 to 1.0. !{:margin_left =&gt;
100}man-ele-progress.png!</p>

<p>A simple progress bar is 200 pixels wide, but you can use the `:width`
style (as with all <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> elements)
to lengthen it.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Shoes</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>

<p>Take a look at the [[Common]] methods page for a list of methods found an
all elements, including progress bars.</p>

<h3 id="label-fraction%28%29+%C2%BB+a+decimal+number+%3D%3D%3D">fraction() » a decimal number ===</h3>

<p>Returns a decimal number from 0.0 to 1.0, indicating how far along the
progress bar is.</p>

<h3 id="label-fraction+%3D+a+decimal+number+%3D%3D%3D">fraction = a decimal number ===</h3>

<p>Sets the progress to a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>

<h2 id="label-Radio+%3D%3D">Radio ==</h2>

<p>Radio buttons are a group of clickable circles. Click a circle and it’ll be
marked. Only one radio button can be marked at a time. (This is similar to
the ListBox, where only one option can be selected at a time.)
!{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-radio.png!</p>

<p>So, how do you decide when to use radio buttons and when to use list boxes?
Well, list boxes only show one highlighted item unless you click on the box
and the drop-down appears. But radio buttons are all shown, regardless of
which is marked.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  para &quot;Among these films, which do you prefer?\n&quot;
  radio; para strong(&quot;The Taste of Tea&quot;), &quot; by Katsuhito Ishii\n&quot;
  radio; para strong(&quot;Kin-Dza-Dza&quot;), &quot; by Georgi Danelia\n&quot;
  radio; para strong(&quot;Children of Heaven&quot;), &quot; by Majid Majidi\n&quot;
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>Only one of these three radios can be checked at a time, since they are
grouped together in the same slot (along with a bunch of `para`.)</p>

<p>If we move them each into their own slot, the example breaks.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para &quot;Among these films, which do you prefer?&quot;
    flow { radio; para &quot;The Taste of Tea by Katsuhito Ishii&quot; }
    flow { radio; para &quot;Kin-Dza-Dza by Georgi Danelia&quot; }
    flow { radio; para &quot;Children of Heaven by Majid Majidi&quot; }
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>This can be fixed, though. You can group together radios from different
slots, you just have to give them all the same group name.</p>

<p>Here, let’s group all these radios in the `:films` group.</p>

<p>{{{</p>

<pre>#!ruby
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para &quot;Among these films, which do you prefer?&quot;
    flow do
      radio :films
      para &quot;The Taste of Tea by Katsuhito Ishii&quot;
    end
    flow do
      radio :films
      para &quot;Kin-Dza-Dza by Georgi Danelia&quot;
    end
    flow do
      radio :films
      para &quot;Children of Heaven by Majid Majidi&quot;
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>}}}</p>

<p>For more methods beyond those listed below, also look into the [[Common]]
methods page. Because you get those methods on every radio as well.</p>

<h3 id="label-checked%3F%28%29+%C2%BB+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked?() » true or false ===</h3>

<p>Returns whether the radio button is checked or not. So, `true` means “yes,
it is checked!”</p>

<h3 id="label-checked+%3D+true+or+false+%3D%3D%3D">checked = true or false ===</h3>

<p>Marks or unmarks the radio button. Using `checked = false`, for instance,
clears the radio.</p>

<h3 id="label-click%28%29+%7B+%7Cself%7C+...+%7D+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">click() { |self| … } » self ===</h3>

<p>When the radio button is clicked, its `click` block is called. The block is
handed `self`, which is an object representing the radio which was clicked.</p>

<p>Clicks are sent for both marking and unmarking the radio.</p>

<h3 id="label-focus%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">focus() » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves focus to the radio. The radio will be highlighted and, if the user
hits Enter, the radio will be toggled between its marked and unmarked
states.</p>

<h2 id="label-Shape+%3D%3D">Shape ==</h2>

<p>A shape is a path outline usually created by drawing methods like `oval`
and `rect`. !{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-shape.png!</p>

<p>See the [[Common]] methods page.  Shapes respond to all of those methods.</p>

<h2 id="label-TextBlock+%3D%3D">TextBlock ==</h2>

<p>The TextBlock object represents a group of text organized as a single
element. A paragraph containing bolded text, for example. A caption
containing links and bolded text. (So, a `caption` is a TextBlock type. 
However, `link` and `strong` are TextClass types.) !{:margin_left =&gt;
100}man-ele-textblock.png!</p>

<p>All of the various types of TextBlock are found on the [[Element Element
Creation]] page.</p>

<pre>* [[Element.banner]], a 48 pixel font.
* [[Element.title]], a 34 pixel font.
* [[Element.subtitle]], a 26 pixel font.
* [[Element.tagline]], an 18 pixel font.
* [[Element.caption]], a 14 pixel font.
* [[Element.para]], a 12 pixel font.
* [[Element.inscription]], a 10 pixel font.</pre>

<h3 id="label-contents%28%29+%C2%BB+an+array+of+elements++%3D%3D%3D">contents() » an array of elements  ===</h3>

<p>Lists all of the strings and styled text objects inside this block.</p>

<h3 id="label-replace%28a+string%29+%3D%3D%3D">replace(a string) ===</h3>

<p>Replaces the text of the entire block with the characters of `a string`.</p>

<h3 id="label-text%28%29+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">text() » a string ===</h3>

<p>Return a string of all of the characters in this text box. This will strip
off any style or text classes and just return the actual characters, as if
seen on the screen.</p>

<h3 id="label-text+%3D+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">text = a string ===</h3>

<p>Replaces the text of the entire block with the characters of `a string`.</p>

<h3 id="label-to_s%28%29+%C2%BB+a+string+%3D%3D%3D">to_s() » a string ===</h3>

<p>An alias for [[TextBlock.text]]. Returns a flattened string of all of this
TextBlock’s contents.</p>

<h2 id="label-Timers+%3D%3D">Timers ==</h2>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> contains three timer classes:
the Animation class, the Every class and the Timer class. Both Animations
and Everies loop over and over after they start.  Timers happen once. A
one-shot timer.</p>

<p>Animations and Everies are basically the same thing. The difference is that
Animations usually happen many, many times per second. And Everies happen
only once every few seconds or rarely.</p>

<h3 id="label-start%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">start() » self ===</h3>

<p>Both types of timers automatically start themselves, so there’s no need to
use this normally. But if you [[Timers.stop]] a timer and would like to
start it up again, then by all means: use this!</p>

<h3 id="label-stop%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">stop() » self ===</h3>

<p>Pauses the animation or timer. In the case of a one-shot timer that’s
already happened, it’s already stopped and this method will have no effect.</p>

<h3 id="label-toggle%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">toggle() » self ===</h3>

<p>If the animation or timer is stopped, it is started. Otherwise, if it is
already running, it is stopped.</p>

<h2 id="label-Video+%3D%3D">Video ==</h2>

<p><a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a> supports embedding of
QuickTime, Flash video (FLV), DivX, Xvid and various other popular video
formats. This is all thanks to VideoLAN and ffmpeg, two sensational open
source libraries. Use the `video` method on a slot to setup a <a
href="../../classes/Shoes/Video.html">Shoes::Video</a> object.
!{:margin_left =&gt; 100}man-ele-video.png!</p>

<p>In addition to video formats, some audio formats are also supported, such
as MP3, WAV and Ogg Vorbis.</p>

<p>Video support is optional in <a href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>
and some builds do not support video. For example, video support is
unavailable for PowerPC. When you download <a
href="../../classes/Shoes.html">Shoes</a>, the build for your platform will
be marked `novideo` in the filename if no video support is available.</p>

<h3 id="label-hide%28%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">hide() » self ===</h3>

<p>Hides the video. If already playing, the video will continue to play. This
just turns off display of the video. One possible use of this method is to
collapse the video area when it is playing an audio file, such as an MP3.</p>

<h3 id="label-length%28%29+%C2%BB+a+number+%3D%3D%3D">length() » a number ===</h3>

<p>The full length of the video in milliseconds. Returns nil if the video is
not yet loaded.</p>

<h3 id="label-move%28left%2C+top%29+%C2%BB+self+%3D%3D%3D">move(left, top) » self ===</h3>

<p>Moves the video to specific coordinates, the (left, top) being the upper
