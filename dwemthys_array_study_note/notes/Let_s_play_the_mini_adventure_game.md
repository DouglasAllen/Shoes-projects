Let's play the mini adventure game
==================================

At first, let's play the Dwemthy's Array (mini adventure game).

1. Download the following codes written by **\_why**.
	+ [dwemthy.rb](http://github.com/ashbb/dwemthys_array_study_note/tree/master/whys_code/dwemthy.rb)
	+ [rabbit.rb](http://github.com/ashbb/dwemthys_array_study_note/tree/master/whys_code/rabbit.rb)

2. Run IRB with simple prompt mode.

	`irb --prompt simple`

3. Look at my [scoreline log](http://github.com/ashbb/dwemthys_array_study_note/tree/master/steps/scoreline.log).

	+ line 3 and 6: Require two files.
	+ line 9-14 and 17-22: Define two monsters.
	+ line 25: Create a fake dwemthy's array. Because the array has only two monsters. ;-)
	+ line 28: Create a first rabbit.
	+ line 31: Fight the ScubaArgentine (first monster). The symbols, `%(lettuce), *(bomb), /(sword) and ^(boomerang)` are methods defined in the file `rabbit.rb`.
	+ line 32-35: The messages shown by the program.
	+ line 40-41: First monster has died and next monster has emerged.
	+ line 50: First rabbit has died.
	+ line 57: Create the second rabbit to continue the game.
	+ line 72-73: Second monster has died. You (rabbits) win! To FAKE dwemthy's array, though... :-P
