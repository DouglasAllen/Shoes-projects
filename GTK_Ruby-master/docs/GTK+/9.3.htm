<h1>9.3. Common Range Methods</h1>

<p>The Range widget class is fairly complicated, but like all the "base class" widgets, most of its complexity is only
intresting if you want to hack on it. Also, almost all of the methods and signals it defines are only really used in
writing derived widgets (at the C level). There are, however, a few useful methods that are defined and will work on all
range widgets.</p>
