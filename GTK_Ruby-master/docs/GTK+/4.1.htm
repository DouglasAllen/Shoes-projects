<h1>4.1. More on Signal Handlers</h1>
<p>There are a few things you probably noticied in the previous examples that may need a little explaining. 
Let's take another look at  the <i>#signal_connect</i> method again.</p>

<pre>GLib::Instantiatable#signal_connect( name, data ) { |widget, data| callback_method }</pre>

<p>As stated before, you can have as many callbacks per signal 
and per object as you need, and each will be executed in turn, 
in the order they were attached.</p>

<p>This tag allows you to remove this callback from the list by using:</p>

<pre>GLib::Instantiatable#signal_handler_disconnect</pre>

<p>So, by passing in the widget you wish to remove the handler from, and 
the tag returned by one of the signal_connect methods, you can disconnect 
a signal handler.</p>

<p>You can also temporarily disable signal handlers with the 
GLib::Instantiatable#signal_handler_block and 
GLib::Instantiatable#signal_handler_unblock methods.</p>

<pre>GLib::Instantiatable#signal_handler_block
GLib::Instantiatable#signal_handler_unblock
</pre>
