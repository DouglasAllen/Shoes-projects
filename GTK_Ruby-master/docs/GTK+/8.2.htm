<h1>8.2. Using Adjustments the Easy Way</h1>

<p>The adjustable widgets can be roughly divided into those which use and require specific units for these values 
and those which treat them as arbitrary numbers. The group which treats the values as arbitrary numbers includes the 
range widgets (scrollbars and scales, the progress bar widget, and the spin button widget). These widgets are all the 
widgets which are typically "adjusted" directly by the user with the mouse or keyboard. They will treat the lower and 
upper values of an adjustment as a range within which the user can manipulate the adjustment's value. By default, they 
will only modify the value of an adjustment.</p>

<p>The other group includes the text widget, the viewport widget, the compound list widget, and the scrolled window widget. 
All of these widgets use pixel values for their adjustments. These are also all widgets which are typically "adjusted" 
indirectly using scrollbars. While all widgets which use adjustments can either create their own adjustments or use 
ones you supply, you'll generally want to let this particular category of widgets create its own adjustments. 
Usually, they will eventually override all the values except the value itself in whatever adjustments you give them, but 
the results are, in general, undefined (meaning, you'll have to read the source code to find out, and it may be different 
from widget to widget).</p>

<p>Now, you're probably thinking, since text widgets and viewports insist on setting everything except the value of their 
adjustments, while scrollbars will only touch the adjustment's value, if you share an adjustment object between a scrollbar 
and a text widget, manipulating the scrollbar will automagically adjust the viewport widget? Of course it will! Just like 
this:</p>

<pre># Creates it's own adjustments
viewport = Gtk::Viewport.new( nil, nil )

# Uses the newly-created adjustment for the scrollbar as well
vscrollbar = Gtk::VScrollbar.new( viewport.vadjustment? )
</pre>
