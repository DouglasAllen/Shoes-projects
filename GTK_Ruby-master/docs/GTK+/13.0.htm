<h1>Chapter 13. Undocumented Widgets</h1>

<p>If you must use one of these widgets that are undocumented, I strongly suggest you take a look at their respective
header files in the GTK distribution (C source). GTK's function names are very descriptive. Once you have an understanding
of how things work, it's not that difficult to figure out how to use a widget sinply by looking at it's function declarations.
This, along with a few examples from other's code, and it should be no problem.</p>

<p>These widgets will eventually be documented by me, or by someone else. Please be aware that they are NOT a high priority
at the moment. The API documentation will most likely be done before I document these widgets, so if you feel like writting
something up on them, please feel free to notify the mailing list of send me an email direct.</p>
