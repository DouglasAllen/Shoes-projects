<H1>18.1. Overview</H1>

<p>An application capable of GTK+ drag-and-drop first defines and sets up the GTK+ widget(s) for drag-and-drop. Each widget can
be a source and/or destination for drag-and-drop. Note that these GTK+ widgets must have an associated X Window.</p>

<p>Source widgets can send out drag data, thus allowing the user to drag things off them, while destination widgets can
receive drag data. Drag-and-drop destinations can limit who they accept data from, e.g. the same application or any 
application (including itself).</p>

<p>Sending and receiving drop data makes use of GTK+ signals. Dropping an item to a destination widget requires both a data
request (for the source widget) and data received signal handler (for the target widget). Additional signal handlers can be
connected if you want to know when a drag begins (at the very instant it starts), to when a drop is made, and when the entire
drag-and-drop procedure has ended (successfully or not).</p>

<p>Your application will need to provide data for source widgets when requested, that involves having a drag data request 
signal handler. For destination widgets they will need a drop data received signal handler.</p>

<p>So a typical drag-and-drop cycle would look as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Drag begins.</li>
	<li>Drag data request (when a drop occurs).</li>
	<li>Drop data received (may be on same or different application.)</li>
	<li>Drag data delete (if drag was a move).</li>
	<li>Drag-and-Drop procedure done.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few minor steps that go in between here and there, but we will get into detail about that later.</p>
