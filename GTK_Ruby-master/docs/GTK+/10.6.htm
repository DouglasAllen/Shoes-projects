<h1>10.6. Rulers</h1>

<p>Ruler widgets are used to indicate the location of the mouse pointer in a given window. A window 
can have a vertical ruler spanning across the width and a horizontal ruler spanning down the height. 
A small triangular indicator on the ruler shows the exact location of the pointer relative to the ruler.</p>

<p>A ruler must first be created. Horizontal and vertical rulers are created using</p>

<pre>Gtk::HRuler.new    # horizontal ruler

Gtk::VRuler.new    # vertical ruler
</pre>

<p>Once a ruler is created, we can define the unit of measurement. Units of measure for rulers 
can be <i>Gtk::PIXELS, Gtk::INCHES</i> or <i>Gtk::CENTIMETERS</i>. This is set using</p>

<pre>Gtk::Ruler#set_metric( metric )
Gtk::Ruler#metric=( metric )
</pre>

<p>The default measure is <i>Gtk::PIXELS</i>.</p>

<pre>Gtk::Ruler#set_metric( Gtk::PIXELS )
Gtk::Ruler#metric=( Gtk::PIXELS )
</pre>

<p>Other important characteristics of a ruler are how to mark the units of scale and where 
the position indicator is initially placed. These are set for a ruler using</p>

<pre>Gtk::Ruler#set_range( lower, upper, position, max_size )
Gtk::Ruler#range=( lower, upper, position, max_size )
</pre>

<p>The <i>lower</i> and <i>upper</i> arguments define the extent of the ruler, and <i>max_size</i> is the largest
possible number that will be displayed. <i>Position</i> defines the initial position of the pointer
indicator within the ruler.</p>

<p>A vertical ruler can span an 800 pixel wide window thus</p>

<pre>Gtk::Ruler#set_range( 0, 800, 0, 800 )
Gtk::Ruler#range=( 0, 800, 0, 800 )
</pre>

<p>The markings displayed on the ruler will be from 0 to 800, with a number for every 100 pixels. 
If instead we wanted the ruler to range from 7 to 16, we would code</p>

<pre>Gtk::Ruler#set_range( 7, 16, 0, 20 )
Gtk::Ruler#range=( 7, 16, 0, 20 )
</pre>

<p>The indicator on the ruler is a small triangular mark that indicates the position of the 
pointer relative to the ruler. If the ruler is used to follow the mouse pointer, the <i>motion_notify_event</i>
signal should be connected to the <i>motion_notify_event<i> method of the ruler. To follow all mouse movements
within a window area, we would use</i></i></p>

<pre><i><i>??????</i></i></pre>

<p><i><i>The following example creates a drawing area with a horizontal ruler above it and a vertical 
ruler to the left of it. The size of the drawing area is 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels high. The 
horizontal ruler spans from 7 to 13 with a mark every 100 pixels, while the vertical ruler spans 
from 0 to 400 with a mark every 100 pixels. Placement of the drawing area and the rulers is done 
using a table.</i></i></p>
