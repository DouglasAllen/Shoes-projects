<h1>10.4 Progress Bars</h1>

<p>Progress bars are used to show the status of an operation. They are pretty easy to 
use, as you will see with the code below. But first lets start out with the calls to 
create a new progress bar.</p>

<pre>Gtk::ProgressBar.new</pre>

<p>Now that the progress bar has been created we can use it.</p>

<pre>Gtk::ProgressBar#set_fraction( fraction )
Gtk::ProgressBar#fraction=( fraction )
</pre>

<p>The first and only argument is the amount "completed", meaning the amount the progress bar 
has been filled from 0-100%. This is passed to the method as a real number ranging from 0 to 1.</p>

<p>A progress bar may be set to one of a number of orientations using the method</p>

<pre>Gtk::ProgressBar#set_orientation( orientation )
Gtk::ProgressBar#orientation=( orientation )
</pre>

<p>The <i>orientation</i> argument may take one of the following values to indicate the direction in
which the progress bar moves:</p>

<pre>Gtk::Progress::LEFT_TO_RIGHT
Gtk::Progress::RIGHT_TO_LEFT
Gtk::Progress::BOTTOM_TO_TOP
Gtk::Progress::TOP_TO_BOTTOM
</pre>

<p>As well as indicating the amount of progress that has occured, the progress bar may be set 
to just indicate that there is some activity. This can be useful in situations where progress 
cannot be measured against a value range. The following method indicates that some progress 
has been made.</p>

<pre>Gtk::ProgressBar#pulse</pre>

<p>The step size of the activity indicator is set using the following method.</p>

<pre>Gtk::ProgressBar#pulse_step=( fraction )</pre>

<p>When not in activity mode, the progress bar can also display a configurable text string 
within its trough, using the following method.</p>

<pre>Gtk::ProgressBar#set_text( text )
Gtk::ProgressBar#text=( text )
</pre>

<p>You can turn off the display of the string by calling Gtk::ProgressBar#set_text again with nil as the argument.</p>

<p>The current text setting of a progressbar can be retrieved with the following method.</p>

<pre>Gtk::ProgressBar#text</pre>

<p>Progress Bars are usually used with timeouts or other such methods (see section on Timeouts, I/O
and Idle methods) to give the illusion of multitasking. All will employ the #set_fraction or #pulse 
methods in the same manner.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the progress bar, updated using timeouts. This code also shows you how to
reset the Progress Bar.</p>
